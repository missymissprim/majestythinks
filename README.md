# Digital Garden
The Notetakerâ€™s Vault is an online repository of notes, observations and insights from various worlds across the D&D multiverse. It includes detailed reports on quests, maps, non-player characters (NPCS), and other game content. The vault is open to all players in the game, allowing anyone to contribute their experiences to the wealth of knowledge available.

The vault originates from Obsidian and has been published online for ease of access using the [Digital Obsidian Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden) template and the [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden).
