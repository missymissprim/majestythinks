>[!session] [[Through the Planes/Session Notes/Session 009 - 06102022\| Session 009]]
>The Cursed Keepers continue their journey through Yon running into a goblin procession, who have the power to commune with the dead. Silas learns a few things about himself, his friends, and Angira, who he knew to be dead. They run into a couple of shadows, and eventually come across eight beacons that form a ring around a lake, where a figure attempts to light the beacons despite being harassed by a group of perytons. 


</div></div>


The elven figure begins to row towards the Cursed Keepers, who have just defeated the performing [[Peryton\|perytons]] and stand along the lakeshore. As they wait and discuss their initial distrust, their consciousness is lurched out of their bodies towards a mirrored fractal fey-like forest, where they encounter [[Puck\|Puck]], who they are familiar with, and [[Through the Planes/NPCs/Faunus\|Faunus]], an unusually large armored centaur with majestic antlers and piercing raven-like eyes with a yellowish hue.

Faunus briefly introduces himself before explaining that [[Through the Planes/NPCs/Zaahira\|Zaahira]] needs rest and that the two of them will be their guides for the remainder of their journey in [[Prismeer\|Prismeer]]. His stern approach puts off the group as they express their frustration and distrust. Silas asks them why Zaahira has not graced them with her presence, inciting to two servant’s to share a glance. Puck responds, “She just needs rest.” 

Silas extends his psionic abilities through his psionic crystal to enter their minds to glean information about Zaahira and her whereabouts. He sees her, entering a mirrored kaleidoscopic space — each mirror shows instances of action, some of their current and future journey, others of different settings, planes, and heroes alike. She appears tired and emaciated — even more so than when Silas last saw her. She plops herself onto a plush cushion. Her conspiracy begin to gather around her large form — she appears larger than Faunus, who takes her hand. Her breathing is labored, though she smiles and tells them she’s fine, just needs rest for a moment.

>Big things are happening ... there’s been an ascension. A very glorious time ...
>
>— Zaahira to the [[Conspiracy\|Conspiracy]]



Faunus asks what she would like them to do, understanding the context of her words. She assures him she just needs to rest ... “this is the first nap.” She instructs him and Puck to watch over “the children” — the Cursed Keepers. The memory ends.

Faunus looks down at Silas, recognizing his mind was briefly invaded as Olive pulls Silas aside. Puck separates from Faunus to speak to Nova alone. He attempts to warn her about her “lost thing,” and what retrieving it may entail. 

“You believe you’re just getting back one thing don’t you?”

She quickly responds, “Yep, my inches.”

“It’ll be more than that, Nova.” His expression pains. “It’ll be more than that ...”

Puck asks if she’ll be prepared for after, telling her she’ll be hit with a revelation but it will be quite an ordeal. He plainly asks, “... is it truly *height* that you *want* ... need?”

Confused, Nova asks if the conversation relates to her recent visions. It’s possible. She admits she doesn’t appreciate his vagueness,  and he reveals they (the servants) only know so much — “Only the Teller knows.” Feeling uncomfortable by his mannerisms, she points out she doesn’t know how to prepare for something she’s not being prepared for, and believes he’s a little crazy.

>We’re all probably a little plagued by a bit of madness. When you learn things outside of your own domain, it opens your mind to other things ... and it kinds of breaks you.
>
>— Puck to Nova

Nova makes Puck laugh which creeps her out more after saying everyone needs to be a little broken. “Are you ready to be broken? ... Are any of you really ready to be broken?”

Despite the uneasy feeling, she expresses her excitement to receive her height back. Puck in turn responds that he hopes her mind will stay in tact, and wishes her luck.

Silas and Olive quietly conversed amongst themselves while being stared down by Faunus, unaffected by his presence as Nova talked with Puck. He asks if receiving Bumper back was what she expected it to be. It was and it wasn’t ... she realizes she cannot go straight back home as the group have found themselves in quite the entanglement.

As Nova joins the group, Faunus asks if they have any questions before they leave them to their adventure. Silas asks about the [[Brigganock Mine\|Brigganock Mine]], learning it will help them in the long run and may be the safer option to enter [[Motherhorn\|Motherhorn]]. He asks about the unsafe option, to which Faunus laughs and says, “Why, the front door.”

The Cursed Keepers are quiet for a moment, and Faunus asks if that is all their questions. Silas is unsure if he wants to ask all of his questions, though Faunus suggests he go ahead and put them out there. They may be answered as they were’t instructed not to answer them.

Silas asks about his parents. Faunus expresses such an answer would be best said by Zaahira, as she knows “clearer” details, he only knows a few things in passing. Silas asks if they are alive, but Faunus unfortunately does not know. Zaahira, the Teller, would.

Frustrated, Silas asks about her *cryptic* title. Faunus explains that all gods, or rather higher beings, have titles (i.e. Selûne, the Moonmaiden). He continues that where she is from, “god” is not given to someone of her status, but if she were to be in their domain (the Forgotten Realms), she would be considered a god. Silas asks about her domain, to which Faustus deflects and talks about her province instead, revealing that her province over chaos, divination, planar travel, and the truth. <span class="spoiler">Your DM misheard ... you meant where is she from ... but this works out lol. 😜</span>

>... do know she would never lie to you ... Child of Chaos.
>
>— Faunus to Silas in regards to the Truth

Nova attempts to callout Silas for his alias, but Faunus reminds her that she and Olive both have their respective aliases — the Child of Stars, and the Child of Shadows. He hints that such aliases may have an ominous connotation whether they sound nice or not. Faunus continues that they dubbed themselves as “cursed” so why should any of this be a surprise ...

Olive admits it all makes since, especially since shadows seem to be either a hit or miss.

Silas calls Faunus out, referring back to when Faunus admitted Zaahira can never tell a lie — asking if they can. He then asks whether or not his previous statement about her character is truth. Faunus calmly tells them that it is up to them to decide whether he is telling the truth or not. Olive tests him with a slight show of magic on a pen. <span class="spoiler">Puck quietly snickers in the background, seeing as these kids challenge the centaurs patience.</span> Faunus assures them that they would not lie to them as they are too important to their mistress, and that they have much to learn before they pass him.

Silas ends his questions, and Faunus moves to the girls, though Nova admits she has no questions. Faunus pointedly asks if that’s because she’s running away. He hints that her journey will not end with retrieving her height and restoring Prismeer.

Olive asks about the attack in her dream a couple of night’s prior. Faunus admits he only know surface details about the three of them; Zaahira doesn’t want to admit everything in fear of it all unraveling. There are forces after Olive because she is special, though she doesn’t know exactly what that means. Frustrated, Olive demands to hear something she hasn’t already heard from Zaahira. Faunus adds, “You’re just like her,” but doesn’t give an explanation because he doesn’t fully understand what she is.



Olive asks if “her” is in reference to the [[Obsidian Gate\|Obsidian Gate]]. Faunus corrects her and specifies he was referring to Zaahira. He notes that she sounds disappointed — she hoped to get more answers. He apologizes for his lack of knowledge on the Obsidian Gate and what lies beyond. Again, he reminds them they only know so much and they can only give so much.

Olive expresses her frustrations, getting the runaround from Zaahira and not finding her answers in books. To lighten the mood and get under his skin, she asks why Faunus is big and if he’s big everywhere ... 😅, she continues asking if he’s considered naked or clothed. He sighs deeply, “Such an immature question.” <span class="spoiler">Puck “dies” in the background, struggling to hold back his laughter, but because it’s Puck, it’s obviously a bit creepy.</span>

Silas gets close to Faunus and activates his [[truesight\|truesight]]. He sees a normal centaur and an elf, though at their core he sees Zaahira’s essence within them, as though they are connected to her. He then looks down at himself, and finds a swirl of chaos, of light and darkness, fighting one another. He touches the psionic crystal, the swirl grows and quickens, then suddenly lessens and tames — back and forth erratically, it’s never stable. He feels comforted by the crystal, however, feels anxiety upon the realization of untapped potential.

Faunus apologizes that they were not as helpful as the group had hoped, but assures them that it will all make sense at a later time, looking pointedly at Olive. He tells them they will see Zaahira in time. He and Puck begin to recede into the background and the space around the Cursed Keepers begins to crack like broken glass. Their consciousness is suddenly returned as though without warning, leaving them with whiplash as they return to the scene of the elven figure approaching them via rowboat.

[[Alagarthas\|Alagarthas]] introduces himself to the Cursed Keepers, and thanks them for their involuntary help in dealing with the perytons. He attempts to open the conversation; however, the group remains skeptical, though he’s fortunately understanding. He reveals he is originally from [[Faerûn\|Faerûn]], specifically the [[Misty Forest\|Misty Forest]] (where the group first met when they visited the [[Witchlight Carnival\|Witchlight Carnival]]), and is trying to get back home. He made a deal with [[Endelyn Moongrave\|Endelyn Moongrave]], which forced him to remain in [[Yon\|Yon]] for a year, and he hopes to get back in order to deal with a dragon.

Silas admits they are also wanting to return to Faerûn, prompting Alagarthas to share that the lake would be particularly helpful. In order to get home, he needs to light the eight beacons alone without assistance. The perytons unfortunately prolonged his suffering, preventing him from initially completing the task. Silas asks for elaboration, which Alagarthas shares willingly. Supposedly lighting all eight beacons will open a portal, hopefully “home.” He suggests the group rest for the evening, while he completes his task.

Silas asks the girls whether or not they believe this is a sick trick from Endelyn that would harm Alagarthas. He asks Olive specifically about runes and portals, hoping to prevent the elf from wasting his (and their) time. Olive attempts to think back to her studies, though only recalls basic teleportation machinations and rituals. 🧠🧠🧠

Nova suggests flying, and out of no where, Silas comments on her physicality — “Your legs must be super atrophied ...” 😅 He begins to ask very personal questions about her shoulder muscles, etc. She points out that her height affects her walking, especially around larger folk, though around other small folk she walks comfortably. He then asks when was the last time she hung around pixies <span class="spoiler">forgetting they were around pixies a “few days ago” while in the Witchlight Carnival</span>. 

Nova promptly expresses her dislike for pixies, and Silas immediately wants to unpack that, wanting to learn more about his small feisty companion. He assumes she dislikes herself.

<span class="sticky">It’s a bit hypocritical, even if his backstory (somewhat) justifies his response.</span>

She admits she hates their “always cheery” disposition, but loves herself. <span class="spoiler">Cue two natural 1s for insight and deception, but Nova’s +6 wins it out. 🤣</span> Silas believes her, though Olive (and others) don’t buy it — she’s bad at lying, but he’s bad at reading people. She continues that they are disgustingly obnoxious — high-pitch voice fast diction, and all — she’s nothing like them. He agrees as she adds they smell sickeningly sweet, despite smelling like brownies and lavender herself.

Silas goes to subtly smell Nova, sarcastically adds he imagines she smells nothing like other pixies. “I smell great ... they smell *stupid.*”

She takes pride in her differences and wants nothing to do with pixie-folk because she finds them annoying. Olive equates it similarly to her parents who looked down at other half-elves. Though Nova argues she doesn’t look down on them, just doesn’t want to be like them — she later admits everyone annoys her. She admits she’s different and doesn’t fit in anywhere, and Silas agrees all three of them have that in common.

Nova displays her jealousy for height and how he and Olive can just walk around, establishing that her height is an inconvenience. Silas does attempt to correct her as his appearance is an anomaly, which doesn’t really allow him to “walk around.” She angrily states that her kryptonite is a bowl or rather any decently sized container. Silas argues he would pay the person who could keep her in a bowl, hinting she’d put up a good fight and escape. However, she angrily states that the problem is that people assume they can step on her — such an experience terrifies her.

>Have you ever transformed into an ant to see how it would live and then realize it’s very similar to your life, except as a pixie you can step on an ant?
>
>— Nova’s *Existential Crisis*

Silas is flabbergasted upon realizing she transformed into an ant, but Olive interjects that their natural predators are frogs. Nova recounts their time in Downfall, and how terrified she was in the moment of the humanoid sized “predators.”

As their existential discussion comes to a close, Alagarthas lights the first beacon and comes down. Silas and Olive agree to stay up to watch him light the beacons despite his instance that they rest, and Nova jokingly goes to fly up to extinguish the beacon with her wings like the perytons. 

As Nova flies, Silas casts [[mage hand\|mage hand]] to grab her by the wings, and she becomes enraged that her earlier point was proven. She demands he release her, threatening to stab him, but he wants her to promise not to ruin Alagarthas’ hard work, not realizing her wings would do nothing to extinguish the flames. They argue for a bit before she wildshapes into a starry bear, but due to her limitations, she appears to be the size of a cub. 🐻 

Just like little Simba confronting the hyenas, Nova bark unfortunately has no real bite. At first she believes she’s transformed into a powerful bear, but as she approaches Silas and Olive, she realizes they’re growing as she closes the distance. With her wounded pride, she curls up into a ball and goes to sleep just as Alagarthas makes it down to the ground and rows to the next column. 

Silas takes a seat next to her, and apologizes for making her feel small, emphasizing with her, despite knowing she cannot hear him. He stands to find another spot, and sits for awhile, thinking back on his past and feeling guilty.

Olive stays up a bit longer, reluctant to fall asleep, watching Alagarthas light each beacon, though grows bored noticing that takes about an hour to light each beacon. She eventually follows suit lulled to sleep by the soothing waves.

The Cursed Keepers wake and notice seven of the beacons have been lit. They look to see that Alagarthas is close to lighting the last beacon. As he lights it, the flames begins to reflect the image of a lush forest across the surface of the lake. He bows, and dives straight into the lake. After a minute, the ripples fade the forest scene away, and the beacons go out one-by-one.

The party takes mental note of what just happened but are skeptical to light the beacons again, assuming it may need to reset after 24 hours. Olive goes up to investigate the beacon hoping to glean valuable information, but she’s not familiar with the mechanics of teleportation magic — context clues inform her that the portal opens to wherever the person wants as though it were a [[plane shift\|plane shift]] spell. She comes back down, and they join [[Amidor\|Amidor]], [[Pollenella\|Pollenella]], and [[Gleam\|Gleam]] for breakfast before heading out to locate the mines.

After some time, they notice a giant figure in the distance. They get closer and find themselves in the presence of a cyclops, who angrily begins roaring (Giant) and pointing accusing fingers. Amidor unsheathes his rapier in defense, claiming he saved Pollenella, who is now frantic and attempting to hide, from the cyclops “clutches.”

Silas telepathically speaks with the cyclops, named [[Mudlump\|Mudlump]], who accuses Amidor of stealing his queen bee and that he wants her back to make honey mead. Amidor denies such claims. Silas tries to deflect the situation by suggesting that they find Mudlump another queen bee. Unfortunately Mudlump is simple minded and points out that *his* queen bee is right there. Silas offers to find a ✨better✨ queen bee — apparently, all bees know each other and proposes Pollenella recommend a friend. “More honey, better mead.”

Mudlump appears skeptical at first, but Silas reassures him that they will help him as soon as he gets out of the way. The cyclops asks for a promise, and Silas nervously calls attention to Amidor to accept the promise. The interaction frustrates Mudlump who demands they return Pollenella, and he begins attacking the group.

Olive pointedly asks Amidor what did he do, and he answers that he did what any knight would do for their love, prompting the group to help him defend Pollenella. Nova inquires if he can defend himself. 😬

As they fight , Olive distracts Mudlump for a moment with [[minnor illusion\|minnor illusion]] and attempts to smoke out a swarm of bees surrounding Silas. Nova goes feral and bites into Mudlump with [[Primal Savagery\|Primal Savagery]]. 😰🩸 The cyclops eventually notices the illusion, and goes for the real Pollenella, nearly stepping on Silas and bodying Olive with his beehive. She releases a [[shadow bolt\|shadow bolt]] to his face, injuring poor Nova in the process.

Though they defeat Mudlump, out of compassion, Silas deals a nonlethal blow to the back of his neck with his branding iron, knocking they cyclops unconscious. Amidor claps in celebration of their victory, earning a few glares from the Cursed Keepers. Olive attempts to force blame on Amidor, but finds no remorse from the faceless dandelion.

“Bees will make you do crazy things,” Nova chimes in regards to the unconscious cyclops. They all see that Pollenella has calmed drastically.

They walk away to continue looking for the Brigganock mind, but find themselves going in circles, and even run into the goblinoid shadows again. The sky begins to darken, and the storm worsens as the wind picks up. A huge tornado forms and heads towards the party.

Silas tucks [[Luck\|Luck]] in, and Nova follows her, both hiding in Silas’ collar. Everyone then holds onto Silas, overestimating his strength, and they all get swept away in the tornado. Nova throws up in Silas’ pocket ... and then Luck — the rat and pixie rainbow sparkle vomit combination, disgusts him. Eventually the speed of the tornado lessens, stops, and drops them about 80 feet above an amphitheater. Nova initially drops until she remembers she can fly. 😂 However, their sudden descent slows and they land safely with Puck raspy voice filling their heads.

Without caring for his surroundings, Silas dons of his armor and tunic to wash off the vomit. Poor Luck is shaking and green. Olive cleans her with her [[wand of prestidigitation\|wand of prestidigitation]]. She nuzzles into Silas neck and goes to sleep. Silas expresses his discontent with Nova, who argues she did no worse than his mouse, noting that everything she does annoys him.

She proclaims she’s okay, and Amidor adds that while the rest of the group is okay, they are in trouble. Finally taking stock of their environment, they find themselves in the middle of a theatrical rehearsal and setup. All the on-duty masked duty stagehands and various performers look at the obnoxious group perplexed — Gleam uses this moment to hide.

Without skipping a beat, the Cursed Keepers, put on their own act to intimidate and blend in. It works flawlessly, with Silas deceptively deterring their attention to “Act 4.” They learn via observation that the crew is preparing for an upcoming play, *A Tragedy at Twilight*. 

>[!info]- A Tragedy at Twilight
>
>A bright light appears in the evening sky during a royal wedding. The light grows bigger and causes lively discussion between the revelers. It turns out to be a comet that crashes into the wedding, killing everyone.

Some of the stagehands take notes from the group’s entrance and fall, making minor adjustments to their makeshift comet upon seeing Nova’s [[dancing lights\|dancing lights]]. Keeping up with the ruse, Silas suggests that the director thought they needed some ✨inspiration✨ The Cursed Keepers pick apart the play and claim they are *the Critics*, donning a pretentious air of importance that keeps the stagehands and actors at bay.

>**Nova:** Comet ... a joke.
>**Olive:** This play ... is abysmal!
>**Nova:** At best.
>**Silas:** You should never doubt the discerning *eyes* of the of the *Critics*. (Opens his third eye for *drama*)

They huddle briefly to solidify their scam as *the Cursed Critics*. Nova feels a trickle, a sensation — whatever she’s looking for is so close. She frantically looks around and locks eyes with [[Endelyn Moongrave\|Endelyn Moongrave]], who watches from her balcony 40 feet above, neither surprised nor expectant.

While throwing passive-aggressive demands, [[Stagefright\|Stagefright]], the goblin master of ceremonies, approaches the party, attempting to dismantle their deception. It gets a bit existential with some short soul talk.

They introduce themselves — Daydream (Silas), Sheer Dread (Nova), and Badaban (Olive) 🦇 — claiming they were sent by the Critic Bureau of Theater. Stagefright calls them out on their ridiculousness; however, they successfully gaslight him into believing Endelyn kept him out the loop. Stagefright attempts to be more accommodating; the interaction is strained, though his fear of Endelyn prevails. They continue with their intimidation stint, with Olive getting a hold of the script, and they “encourage” Stagefright to lead them to prop storage, obviously disappointed with the comet.

Silas telepathically links with Nova to check up on her, noticing her anxiousnesses. They exit the amphitheater, briefly entering a library before heading to storage, which they find in various states of organization. Silas telepathically shoos Stagefright, and the group continues to stress the goblin out as he scampers away. Stagefright attempts to inform them of the other storage room, but they dismiss him.

For the first time since arriving in Yon, they are without escort. Silas recalls their importance in the grand scheme — Gleam and her sister could be a solution to stopping Endelyn, and Amidor can get them out of Yon — but for now this works in their favor.

They attempt to narrow down their immediate plans: (1) retrieve Nova’s lost thing; (2) get to [[Palace of Heart’s Desire\|Zyblina’s palace]]. The complain about their journey thus far and Zaahira’s appearance/interference — they don’t like fate. 😂

A small masked goblin woman interrupts them, announcing that Endelyn requires their presence, having expected them long before they landed in the amphitheater. Nova informs her they need to locate their assistants, and the little goblin scampers off in fear.

They briefly (yet aggressively) ponder about their titles — the child of stars (starlight), the child or shadows, and the child of chaos — unsure of their meaning or purpose, though Nova argues that her and Olive’s obviously make sense, especially since Olive attacked her with Shadows. The young half-elven wizard apologizes for her [[shadow bolt\|shadow bolt]], but the astral pixie pointedly says she’s *think* about forgiving her later. 

Silas whispers to Olive that Nova holds grudges until she’s given money, to which the pixie  comments that describes a deal and emphasizes she’s fey. Salty, the verdan grumbles that she cheated, referring to their gamble about a week prior. Olive admits she has no money, and Nova assures her she wouldn’t take from her regardless.

<span class="spoiler">What I wouldn’t give to meet the poor sop who made an actual fey deal with her 😂</span>

Exasperated, Silas asks what they’re doing and Nova suggests they go guns a-blazing. Immediately, he asks if that’s the best choice. She uses his title against him, as if it infers his true nature. Silas calls out for Zaahira, hoping to glean information from her 👀👀👀 — he then corrects himself and calls for one of her “lackeys,” butchering Faunus’ name in the process. <span class="spoiler">Why y’all so rude? 😅</span>

>**Silas:** What are their names ... Puck and ...?
>**Nova:** (proudly) Furin.
>**Silas:**  Fen ... Furret.
>**Nova:** Ferret. Faunin.
>**Silas:** Fulin ...
>**Both:** (realization) Fulan!
>**Silas:** (confidently) Fullon.
>**Olive:** (excitedly) Fondle!
>**Silas:** (so sure) Fondle Fullon.
>**Nova:** Full On Fondle.

Puck reaches out to them telepathically, chuckling at their humorous attempts to recall his colleague’s name. Nova quickly asks if they should kill Endelyn. He reminds them they killed one already, it wouldn’t hurt necessarily, may even be less trouble in the future; however they just fought a few hours earlier. Nova then runs through a hypothetical situation: (1) go and talk to her; (2) rest; (3) come back and then kill her?

Silas confidently states that he and Nova nearly took out [[Skabatha\|Skabatha]] by themselves, assuming Endelyn will be a piece of cake especially with Olive present. They recall [[Bavlorna\|Bavlorna]], who they met and conversed with, but never encountered 3-on-1. The thought of one less threat sounds appealing to and a few advocate to kill outright her. 

Puck warns them that she knows about their antics, though she may or may not be upset. Covens follow their own rules  and such ... they argue they did her a favor, believing they can bank on the sisters’ hatred towards one another. Puck reassures them and offers to more expend resources (healing) to help the group, recalling [[feather fall\|feather fall]] from earlier.

While the girls seem appreciative, Silas expresses his suspicious, asking what they would owe the druid. Puck corrects him, and they feel a smile in their heads. The verdan quickly adds that he would like it to be known he did not personally accept the offer. Puck challenges to change his perspective — “Don’t look at it as if you owe her something; look at it as an investment ... she doesn’t want you dead.”

Olive adds, “We’re still her little pawns, for now.”

“You’re not her pawns — we can say that much. *No one* is her pawn.”

“That’s a way of saying *everybody* is,” Silas mumbles under his breath.

“We’re just being *used,*” Nova dryly states. <span class="spoiler">Why are y’all like this? 🥲</span>

Rather than healing, Silas asks for some of his abilities to be restored, assuming they have time manipulation abilities because they stopped time. It would seems the group overestimates Zaahira’s “lackeys” — especially when they want the solution to benefit them. 🙄😒 <span class="spoiler">Who’s using who now?</span> Puck admits “they” cannot speed up time. “Sounds fancy and ... particular, but that is not *our* expertise. Not even really our mistress’ ... but, she would have more of a handle over it.”

While he cannot solve Silas’ current predicament, he is able to heal the girls significantly with [[mass cure wounds\|mass cure wounds]]. He wishes them luck, and chuckles out of their consciousness. Silas admits Puck gives him the heebie-jeebies more than Zaahira. With that, the show must go on.

They step outside, with a flair, and spot the timid goblin waiting not too far. Silas requests she lead them to Endelyn, though she agrees and leads the way, she is shaken and visibly upset by it. She leads them through the library, up two flights of stairs to the third floor balcony, which down into the second floor, where a strange whirling contraption powered by electricity. She leads them to her whereabouts, but immediately scampers away before they open the door, wishing them luck.

Silas checks on Nova, who feels that her lost thing is near, possibly on the same floor across the way. Attempting to remain focused, she suggests they kill the hag first before they go retrieve her height.

>What a woman wouldn’t do for a few extra inches ...

>— Chelsea’s intrusive thoughts winning 😅😂

They all hear a spindly voice beckoning them to enter. They sigh, steeling themselves for the upcoming encounter, and Olive adds, “Alright, let’s keep an eye on each other.”

“Ladies first,” Silas offers, earning a couple of eye rolls and snide remarks — the wimp, the coward, the Child of Cowardice. To which Silas responds, <mark class="hltr-yellow">“Child of you-can-face-your-own-demon.”</mark> 😂😂😂

The Cursed Keepers enter the castle turret, stepping out into the balcony overlooking the amphitheater and find themselves before an emaciated form hidden under layers of an elaborate costume; part dress, part mechanical theater. They all begin to engage in conversation, though Endelyn offers her conditions should they wish to make a bargain. 

Silas implies they already did her a tremendous favor by offing her sister (Skabatha), and pulls out Bavlorna’s *Big Book of Bad Blood* to further his point that they all dislike one another. Olive further states that they know several things about her, how they used Bavlorna’s book against Skabatha, and threatens her with similar tactics. Not keen to fighting, Endelyn compromises with an exchange, offering that the Cursed Keepers perform a play.

Nova initially snubs her nose to the idea, though admits she’s a great actress, prompting Silas to suggest she be the *star* of the show. Endelyn expresses her dislike for puns, chuckling darkly. The Cursed Keepers berate her writers, but she defends them, and admits at times it is entertaining — as entertaining as tragedies get. Noting their options, Endelyn inquires of their next move.

Silas telepathically lets Nova know he’s following her lead. Nova questions Endelyn’s request and the hag elaborates that if they perform satisfactory, she’ll conduct fair negotiations after. Should the play be unsatisfactory she would not be bound by the rule of reciprocity.

Silas and Olive speak telepathically, and Olive assumes that the comet from the play will be real should they perform, believing it’s all a trap. They question whether Endelyn will honor the rules of conduct, and suppose they will be “her tragedy” if they agree.

Nova hears shuffling at the door and points it out to the group. Silas goes to lock the door, though Endelyn notices this, assuming they want a fight. Silas attempts to steer the conversation away from the fight, asking for reassurances should they agree to do the play. She repeats her conditions, but he asks to see what Nova is wanting to retrieve. 

“Why see it when you can *feel* it darling?” She hints that Nova knows it’s close by. They express they cannot trust her, and she expresses similar concerns. She emphasizes they are not currently bargaining, and would be *willing* to bargain after the play, to which Olive adds, “*After* we escape death.”

Perplexed, the hag questions the wizards choice of words, and assures that they will not die, though the play is a tragedy — she loves tragedies. Nova telepathically tells Silas to do what he does best ... chaos. Silas asks for the hag’s word, which she begrudgingly gives, and he attacks her, inciting a surprise round. 😉

As the verdan goes [[invisible\|invisible]] (at least from the hag’s perspective), the girls follow suit, gaining the upper hand and leaving poor Endelyn confused. Silas believes he’s alone for a moment. 😂 A group of voices bang at the door in an attempt to open it.

Endelyn glances at her [[Ornithopter of Flying\|ornithopter]], a mechanical flying contraption, contemplating her options. Silas telepathically tells Olive to destroy the contraption to eliminate her escape routes. She sets the contraption on fire, dropping her invisibility and angering the hag. 😛 She taunts Endelyn with an obscene gesture.

Immediately after, the door burst open, and three [[Darkling\|darklings]] enter the fray to protect their mistress. An [[invisible\|invisible]] Nova activates her dragon starry form, and casts [[ice knife\|ice knife]], doing a significant amount of damage against the unsuspecting darklings. Silas then proceeds to telekinetically shove the burning ornithropter off the balcony, and it crashes 40 feet down into the amphitheater, nearly causing the play to go up in flames.

>**Random stagehand 1:** (Lexie) Not my props!
>**Random Stagehand 2:** (Jacob) The critics are going to *hate* the show now!
>**Random Stagehand 3:** (Chelsea) It’s the opera ghost!
>...
>**Silas:** You should always put safeties on things up in the rafters.
>**Nova:** That’s another mark! 😂

Endelyn assails Olive in a fit of rage with her puppeteer’s lash, hurting the wizard psychically. The darklings go to surround and attack Silas, but he creeps them out as his eyes turn jet black and his voices howl through him. Nova goes to attack Endelyn, hoping for the final blow with [[guiding bolt\|guiding bolt]], but gets distracted as she perceives a “familiar” setting within the Feywild overlapping her current surroundings.

Silas goes to hit Endelyn (natural 20 🙄🥳), draining the hag of her health. She freaks out and [[Polymorph\|polymorphs]] into a brown bear despite Olive’s [[counterspell\|counterspell]]. Olive successfully casts [[Witch Bolt\|Witch Bolt]] ruining the hags polymorph. She attempts to back away, but Endelyn attacks her and she goes down unconscious. Olive feels the shadows around her, lightly touching her; it’s somewhat comforting.

Nova casts [[guiding bolt\|guiding bolt]] — the sky opens, revealing the stars as a bolt of lightning strikes down the hag, wounding her heavily. As Silas strains through the pain, losing blood and his life force, he shoves Endelyn to the ground and slams the branding iron onto her form. The darklings run upon seeing their mistress fall, afraid to be the Cursed Keeper’s next victims, however their steps fall short as Silas swings around and its them with on fell swoop.

They turn their attention back to the hag, who’s not dead, just unconscious. In a cloud of inky smoke, Endelyn’s form suddenly disappears. They now have purchase of the castle.

Nova feels a pull towards Endelyn’s room, where the Cursed Keepers find scores of marionettes hanging from the ceiling, the floor strewn with old play scripts, and the wall decorated an abundant amount of hourglasses. The steady hiss of falling grains of sand can be heard throughout the room. At the far side of the room in a wide alcove stands a glass doored-wardrobe with a jade eye embedded in it.

Nova goes towards the wardrobe and begins to desperately search for her lost thing. Upon opening the third drawer, she finds a rod/pole — this has to be it, her three inches! She grabs it and grows three inches, now at her full height of 12 inches. She feels her innate magic course through her and make her whole, but for a moment. She then falls to ground entering a deep slumber.

>[!dream]- Nova’s Metaphorical Dream
>You’re surrounded by a sea of stars, color pools, and an endless silver expanse. Soon floating images begin take shape, forming a city, a civilization as if built overnight — structures, temples, buildings, and a mirrored coliseum, which you find yourself standing in at its center. You stand before a crowd, each individual twinkling and cheering for miles and miles. But none shine quite as bright as you, for you shine the brightest amongst all the stars.
>
>In front of you is a worn silver anvil and on top a finished weapon. You pick up the weapon and raise it high for all to see. The cheers become deafening as a bolt of energy escapes through weapon into the endless sky — a beacon of hope, the promise of a future, and the rise of a new court. These thoughts and ideas begin to flood your mind in this moment.
>
>Soon the vision fades, you’re left in the expanse, the ground you stand on reflecting the stars above. The anvil sits, waiting, beckoning. As you approach, it splits in two, and the ground breaks beneath it, like shattered glass, and you fall. Out of the anvil, a slew of weapons descend upon you. They pierce, pin and shackle your body, as the cosmos around you shifts into pure chaos. Flashes of war and death plague your mind, as does grief, guilt, and shame. The stars all fall with you.
>
>The chaos above comes out of view as you fall alone through the void, and fall, and fall, and fall, until you shatter into tens and hundreds of pieces of starlight. Each piece, in various shapes, sizes and brightness decorate the void. Time appears to pass slowly as each star begins to die, losing brightness, one by one, up until the last star, the brightest of them all — even brighter than sun — is left. Soon it too begins to die, getting smaller and dimmer with each passing second. For a moment, there’s nothing but an endless expanse.
>
>Suddenly an explosion, or rather a supernova of great proportion begins to paint your vision, disturbing the stillness, and the stars that had seemingly died, begin to revive from the burst of energy. As the explosion dies down, a ball of colorful light begins to descend through the sea of stars reaching a soft patch of grass. It sits a little while before transforming into the semblance of a humanoid figure.
>
>You appear whole, somewhat — physically at least — but you’re not, as though you are one piece out of many, but not the whole; and for a second you feel alone, hopeless, and lost. Then a small childlike hand reaches out. You stare at it never looking up. Yet, trepidatiously, you extend your hand to take hers. Then the dream shatters, and you begin to fall once again.
>
>You wake up on the floor having fallen, feeling different, feeling sad, feeling disconnected and reconnected, and feeling as though your light is dying, just like your dream.
