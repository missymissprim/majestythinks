## Session Notes
The Cursed Keepers run into the Goblin Procession, who perform rituals to commune with the dead within Prismeer. Silas's otherworldly voices mock him while deviously mentioning searching for his “father”  in regards to speaking with the dead. They may be bullshitting him, but he’s too flabbergasted to understand their intent.

Olive asks if the goblins can speak to the dead from other planes. They confess they could attempt to extend their abilities to do so in exchange for a trinket. Silas attempts to talk to Agnira, wanting to hear her voice again, however the ritual fails as the goblins cannot find purchase of her soul.  Nova attempts to gather more information about Agnira from Silas, curious as uncover the mystery of this particular phenomenon, but he doesn’t feel to open to sharing.

The goblins offer to do the same for the girls, though Olive argues it would be near impossible since the death occurred in another plane.

Silas asks for directions to the Brigganock Mine. They suggest the group follow the sound of the mines.

They continue and find themselves in front of the Astronomer’s throne. Silas sits on it, hoping to gain a new skill, however, Nova drained its magic for the year. Later, Nova notices movement behind them, noticing elongated goblin-like shadows, pointing it out to the group. Silas converses with his voices to see who’s behind them and they inform him there is no physical body.

Olive casts [[30 Resources/Spellbook/Dancing Lights\|dancing lights]], causing the shadows to pull back. The shadows begin to perform strange grotesque acts that are borderline threatening; one pulls off its head and does the worm. Olive’s shadow follows suit, and the three shadow begin to “play” as Olive creates a sensory light effect with her spell.

Attempting to use [[30 Resources/Definitions/Truesight\|truesight]] against the goblin shadows, Silas looks to his group members. Nova is too bright, nearly blinding, to look at directly, but appears as an elf. Olive looks akin to a shadow, though not as threatening as the shadows they’ve encountered nor as the figures that surrounded her before, but at her core is a bright light,  ... “a hint of possibilities, and the feeling that your world is so small.” He silently recalls seeing a similar light in [[60 The Worlds/NPCs/Zaahira\|Zaahira]], though less pronounced due to her ethereal white form.

Silas asks Olive when she began practicing magic — while she’s been studying for years, she’s only been actively applying her studies for about a year or two. He recognizes he knows little about the application, and asks the girls what it’s like. Olive accesses her mental fortitude, while Nova interprets it as gleaning power from the stars (druidic in nature).
