The Cursed Keepers (and company) run into a goblin procession solemnly ringing handbells, who perform rituals to commune with the dead within Prismeer.  Silas's otherworldly voices mock him while deviously mentioning searching for his ‚Äúfather‚Äù  in regards to speaking with the dead. They may be bullshitting him, but he‚Äôs too flabbergasted to understand their intent.

Olive asks if the goblins can speak to the dead from other planes. They confess they could attempt to extend their abilities to do so in exchange for a trinket. Silas attempts to talk to Agnira, wanting to hear her voice again, however the ritual fails as the goblins cannot find purchase of her soul.  Nova attempts to gather more information about Agnira from Silas, curious as uncover the mystery of this particular phenomenon, but he doesn‚Äôt feel to open to sharing.

The goblins offer to do the same for the girls, though Olive argues it would be near impossible since the death occurred in another plane.

Silas asks for directions to the Brigganock Mine. They suggest the group follow the sound of the mines.

They continue and find themselves in front of the Astronomer‚Äôs throne. Silas sits on it, hoping to gain a new skill, however, Nova drained its magic for the year. Later, Nova notices movement behind them, noticing elongated goblin-like shadows, pointing it out to the group. Silas converses with his voices to see who‚Äôs behind them and they inform him there is no physical body.

Olive casts [[dancing lights\|dancing lights]], causing the shadows to pull back. The shadows begin to perform strange grotesque acts that are borderline threatening; one pulls off its head and does the worm. Olive‚Äôs shadow follows suit, and the three shadow begin to ‚Äúplay‚Äù as Olive creates a sensory light effect with her spell.

Attempting to use [[truesight\|truesight]] against the goblin shadows, Silas looks to his group members. Nova is too bright, nearly blinding, to look at directly, but appears as an elf. Olive looks akin to a shadow, though not as threatening as the shadows they‚Äôve encountered nor as the figures that surrounded her before, but at her core is a bright light,  ... ‚Äúa hint of possibilities, and the feeling that your world is so small.‚Äù He silently recalls seeing a similar light in [[Through the Planes/NPCs/Zaahira\|Zaahira]], though less pronounced due to her ethereal white form. He begins to assume he‚Äôs walking amongst ‚Äúgods.‚Äù üòÇüòÖ

Silas asks Olive when she began practicing magic ‚Äî while she‚Äôs been studying for years, she‚Äôs only been actively applying her studies for about a year or two. He recognizes he knows little about the application, and asks the girls what it‚Äôs like. Olive accesses her mental fortitude and memorization, while Nova interprets it as gleaning power from the stars (druidic in nature) ‚Äî a connection of sorts. Nova reveals she was possibly born from a star üå†, inferring that her powers relate to her origins. She doesn‚Äôt talk about it, as others from her past have made her feel weird.

Silas confesses they have seen enough weird that weird isn‚Äôt weird anymore.

>I‚Äôm sure you get *looked* at in your plane ... assuming you‚Äôre from the material plane. You *look* material.

The voices begin to laugh at the assumption. The Cursed Keepers ignore the shadows, who continue to follow, traveling along the mountainous terrain. Eventually they come across a circle of eight columns ‚Äî each 200 feet tall and 150 feet apart ‚Äî forming a ring around a deep crater lake. They notice a torch-bearing figure trudge up the stairs of the column nearest the rowboat moored on the lakeshore. Eight perytons circle in laughter, mocking the figure.

Silas attempts to call the perytons out, shouting for them to leave the figure alone, however, with the distance, his voice does not cary through. (The lake itself is 400 feet in diameter.)

The figure reaches the top of the column and uses his torch to light a beacon, which burns bright as he descends the stairs and boards the rowboat. As he rows towards the next beacon, the perytons extinguish the flame with their wings, laughing and mocking the frustrated figure.

Olive casts [[firebolt\|firebolt]] to torch the beacon, and the figure waves her down in appreciation. Though the perytons extinguish the beacon, and she purposely ‚Äúmisses‚Äù the beacon, hitting one of the perytons, inciting combat.

The Cursed Keepers defeat a majority perytons with ease. Nova hits Silas with one of her healing arrows after stating she‚Äôs craving more blood, surprising him by the *helpful* attack. He takes a moment to process the action.

The last remaining peryton attempts to fly away, though Olive goes after him and hits him with an angry, yet determined, [[firebolt\|firebolt]].
