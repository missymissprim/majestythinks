The instant the ring disappears, the character is [[Petrified\|Petrified]] (no saving throw allowed).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| <input type="checkbox">   | “Deliver this rascal alive and unharmed. As payment, I offer you the power to bring the dead back to life.”                   | Granny Nightshade gives the character an 11-inch-long bone wand. When the character touches the wand to the corpse of a dead Humanoid, the wand turns to dust as the corpse transforms into a [[Zombie\|Zombie]] with vague recollections of its past life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| <input type="checkbox">   | “This rapscallion vexes me. Deliver him to me alive and unharmed, and I’ll curse one creature whom you name.”                 | The instant the character identifies the target of the curse, a [[Bestow Curse\|Bestow Curse]] spell affects that creature (no saving throw allowed). Granny Nightshade does not have to see or touch the target for the spell to take effect, and the target can be any creature, including Granny Nightshade herself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| <input type="checkbox">   | “How dare this ragamuffin defy me? Bring him to me alive and unharmed, and I’ll grant you a loyal servant.”                   | Granny Nightshade gives the character a friendly [[Frog\|Frog]] companion that has an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak and understand Common.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| <input type="checkbox">   | “Special offer! Bring this impetuous brat to me, and you can claim one item of your choice from my workshop.”                 | Granny Nightshade is true to her word: the character can claim any one object from her workshop they can see or identify by name. The hag either fetches the item herself or commands a servant to do so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

###### Loomlurch

	- [x] Bobi, Sloane, Zennor, and Star will creep through the woods to the west of the tree and hide just out of sight of the screaming scarecrows.

- [x] A character sits on the [[Yon#Astronomer's Throne\|astronomer’s throne]] gaining proficiency in one of the following skills: [[Arcana\|Arcana]], [[Deception\|Deception]], [[History\|History]], [[Insight\|Insight]], [[Intimidation\|Intimidation]], or [[Survival\|Survival]].
- [ ] The party tells Mudlump that Amidor and Pollenella are in love. If the concept is explained to him, Mudlump declares that he’d like to be in love, too, and gives the party a quest to find his true love. Although the party can try to pair Mudlump up with any creature they deem suitable, his ideal match can be found in the Palace of Heart’s Desire: the fomorian Dubhforgail (see [[Palace of Heart’s Desire#P18. Banquet Hall\|area P18]] in [[Palace of Heart’s Desire\|Palace of Heart’s Desire]]).

- [x] If at least half of the party members succeed on the saving throw, none of them are swept away by the [[Yon#Tornado\|tornado]]. If less than half of them succeed on the saving throw (DC 17 Strength), the tornado whisks the group on the stage in Motherhorn’s amphitheater ([[00 Inbox/Motherhorn#M2. Amphitheater\|Area M2]]). In addition, any character whose saving throw failed by 5 or more loses one nonmagical item in transit (determined by you). This item is not recoverable.
- [x] Help Argantle win the game and receive a [[Star Sapphire\|Star Sapphire]], in accordance with the rule of reciprocity. If the gift is accepted, the gemstone begins to glow faintly. Until it stops glowing 24 hours later, the star sapphire has the properties of a [[Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone)\|Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone)]] that doesn’t require attunement.
###### Locations
- [x] Joins the boisterous [[Yon#Korred Dance\|korred dance]] can impress the korreds with a successful DC 14 Strength ([[Athletics\|Athletics]]) or Charisma ([[Performance\|Performance]]) check. Characters who get a success on either check are taught a special jig which, when performed as an action, allows them to manipulate any korred hair they find in Motherhorn as if using the korreds’ Command Hair trait.
- [x] Help Alagarthas deal with the pertyons so he can light the beacons without further interference and return home to the Misty Forest on the world of Toril.
- [ ] Any character who lights all eight beacons without assistance causes the lake to display an image of whatever place that character calls home.
- [ ] Successfully cross the Reivenwish Chasm, getting past the three [[Flameskull\|flameskulls]] at the midpoint, and meet up with Obud in the grotto up ahead. 
	- [ ] Trade either a treat or offer to end the quarrel between the briggaknocks and korreds, and Obud will show the party the secret route to Motherhorn.
	- [ ] Use the tunnel without Obud’s consent. The brigganock miners will spend the next 8 hours collapsing the tunnel on itself, preventing the characters from returning to the mine by that route.
- [ ] Collect [[Yon#Wish Stones\|wish stones]] from Ajak—crystalized from the wishes at the Witchlight Carnival.
- [ ] Help the brigganocks and korreds settle their differences by either relaying that the brigganocks are not allied with Endelyn to the korreds, or convince the brigganocks that the korreds don’t work for Endelyn. The korreds and the brigganocks unite to aid the characters in Motherhorn (as described in the “[[00 Inbox/Motherhorn#^feyRescue\|Fey to the Rescue!]]” sidebar). Molliver accompanies the combined forces.
###### Motherhorn
- [ ] Perform for Endelyn on her stage ([[00 Inbox/Motherhorn#A Tragedy in the Making\|A Tragedy in the Making]]), either as a distraction or to put Endelyn into a bargining mood.
	- [ ] Endelyn performs auguries in her [[00 Inbox/Motherhorn#M18. Audience Chamber\|audience chamber]] for characters who want to know their futures and who strike a proper bargain with her. Drawing on information fed to her by the Orrery of Tragedies, Endelyn performs a macabre puppet show that reveals how each character is fated to depart the multiverse.
- [ ] Help Hurly reunite with his shadow, located in [[00 Inbox/Motherhorn#M11. Stage Workshop\|area M11]].
- [ ] Save Vig from her fate, and learn more information about navigating Motherhorn and dealing with its denizens.
- [ ] Defeat the detached shadows in the [[00 Inbox/Motherhorn#M10. Shadow Theater\|Shadow Theater]]. Destroying a shadow returns them to their rightful owners.
- [ ] Free Golmo, a captured Brigganock, from Skylla’s clutches.
- [ ] Help untangle Break-a-leg’s strings and learn valuable information about Motherhorn.
- [x] Free Glister from her cell ([[00 Inbox/Motherhorn#M17. Prison\|area M17]]).
	- [ ] Reunite her with her sister, Gleam. Glister and Gleam are willing to go along with any other plan the characters conceive, but the sisters always have each other’s safety uppermost in their minds.
	- [ ] Glister describes her plan for revenge. Grab the fake moon in [[00 Inbox/Motherhorn#M12. Parts Storage\|area M12]], and give it to Glister to create a fake eclipse and seal Endelyn’s fate.
- [x] Ring the bell in the belfry hidden in the ceiling in [[00 Inbox/Motherhorn#M20. Paper Birds and Hidden Belfry\|area M20]] to summon a small flock of giant cranes, one for each member of the party, that will deliver them safely to the Palace of Heart’s Desire.
	- [ ] Characters who skillfully rode a [[Witchlight Carnival#Dragonfly Rides\|giant dragonfly]] in the Witchlight Carnival handle their cranes with such flair that they each receive a feather at the end of the journey. (The giant crane plucks the feather from itself using its beak and places it on the ground within the character’s reach.) A feather allows the rewarded character (and no one else) to cast the [[Feather Fall\|Feather Fall]] spell with no components required. Once its spell is cast, the feather becomes nonmagical.
- [x] Quietly enter Endelyn’s room ([[00 Inbox/Motherhorn#M22. Endelyn’s Room\|area M22]]) without distubring the marionettes. Any character who has interacted with korreds can tell that the marionettes are strung with iron wires made from korred hair, and any character who knows the korreds’ special jig (see “[[Yon#Korred Dance\|Korred Dance]]” earlier in the chapter) can command the hair to wind itself around the marionettes’ jaws, preventing them from screaming.
	- [x] Locate and/or recover **lost thing(s)** from Endelyn Moongrave—located in [[00 Inbox/Motherhorn#M22. Endelyn’s Room\|area M22]].
	- [x] Steal interesting treasure from Endelyn’s room.
