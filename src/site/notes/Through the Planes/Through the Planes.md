## Introduction
Welcome to the Forgotten Realms, where our ‚Äúhumble‚Äù adventure begins near the Misty Forest of Faer√ªn at the Witchlight Carnival where you seem to have lost something. Traveling across the realm and the planes, you find yourself trapped in a series of quests at the behest of a capricious¬†storyteller with the promise of ... well, we shall see won't we?

## Plot
According to the Teller, while traveling through the Forgotten Realms during the Spellplague (1385 DR), the Scribe went missing, supposedly looking for her whereabouts in the other worlds. She has been attempting to find him with little success. The only clue she has is an unfinished manuscript in which the Scribe had taken a particular interest in three individuals: the Child of Starlight, the Child of Chaos, and the Child of Shadows.

Unsure of his plans or intentions, the Teller sought these ‚Äúchildren,‚Äù eventually identifying Nova, Olive and Silas. The Scribe began writing the story as a gift  and as his last attempt to understand the Teller‚Äôs interests, but now it‚Äôs up to her and the children, to finish it.

## Story
A <span class="caps">character</span> who has a <span class="caps">problem</span> meets a <span class="caps">guide</span> who gives them a <span class="caps">plan</span> and <span class="caps">calls them to action</span> that ends in <span class="caps">success</span> and helps them avoid <span class="caps">failure</span>.

##### Act One
1. **Opening Image (1%):** A group of individuals find themselves in line at the Witchlight Carnival in hopes to retrieve something they lost years ago. Little do they know of the journey ahead.
2. **Theme Stated (5%):**
3. **Setup (1‚Äî10%):** Olive, Nova and Silas travel to the Witchlight Carnival and each have lost something precious to them. 
	1. Olive lost Bumper, her stuffed weasel (animal); Nova lost a few inches of her already short height; and Silas lost his empathy and psionic powers. Set on retrieving them quickly, they rush to the Lost and Found, but unfortunately do not find what they‚Äôre looking for. They seek out Mister Witch and Mister Light, hoping to gather more information from them. While participating in the Carnival, they notice that something(s) amiss.
	2. The group reluctantly find themselves in Prismeer on a journey to retrieve their lost items, confront the Hourglass Coven, and free Zybilna from the Palace of Hearts Desire. Along the way they meet the Teller (Zaahira), a trickster being with a lot of power and a whole lot of talk.
	3. Silas retrieves his empathy and psionic powers upon finding a psionic crystal. Upon their awaking he meets Mitra‚Äônim‚Äîa strange being who then offers to help the young Verdan learn how to harness his powers. Silas asks if he knows the Teller, however Mitra‚Äônim does not ‚Äúknow‚Äù her ‚Äî as Asier is distant from the Sentinel state.
	4. Olive retrieves her stuffed weasel, gaining the knowledge needed to successfully cast [[Find Familiar\|Find Familiar]]. In her dreams, she is attacked by shadows who call for her to return home, gaining new powers and strange features. Both Zaahira and Kalai express their remorse in not being able to prevent this, though Zaahira expresses it was unfortunately inevitable. Silas also goes through his own chaotic transformation (mutation) and learns a few things about his companions, Luck, and Zaahira.
	5. Nova finally finds her height, gaining three whole inches, but at the cost of something much more, left with an ominous vision. During this time, Zaahira takes a prolong nap, leaving the Conspiracy to interact with her favorite trio. The group continues through Prismeer, finding themselves at their final destination, the Palace of Heart‚Äôs Desire, with more information about the Sentinels who approached them.

As they journey to the Brigganock Mine, they run into a couple of hiccups along the way, though a sudden tornado lands them right in the heart of Motherhorn. Their sudden presence prompts an immediate conversation with Endelyn that evolves into a fight. Once defeating her, Nova goes to retrieve her ‚Äúlost thing,‚Äù finally gaining back her height. However, once touching the object, she is forced into a dream-like vision that leaves her with mixed interpretations and feelings. |
