>Accept your fate, learn to obey, and you may survive.

>— Mistress Ilvara

We have been captured by the drow, locked in a cold, dark cave, with the heavy weight of metal tight around our throats and wrists. Our captors include a cruel drow priestess, [[The Abyss/NPCs/Ilvara Mizzrym\|Mistress Ilvara]] of House Mizzrym. We are not alone; other prisoners are trapped with us:

- [[The Abyss/NPCs/Buppido\|Buppido]], a talkative and cunning [[derro\|derro]]
- [[Derendril\|Derendril]], a [[quaggoth\|quaggoth]] who claims to be a cursed elf prince
- [[Eldeth\|Eldeth]], a shield dwarf scout from Gauntlgrym
- [[The Abyss/NPCs/Jimjar\|Jimjar]], a deep gnome with a gambling problem
- [[The Abyss/NPCs/Ront\|Ront]], an [[orc\|orc]] bully
- [[Sarith\|Sarith]], a drow accused of murder
- [[Shuushar\|Shuushar]], a [[Kuo-toa\|Kuo-toa]] hermit and mystic
- [[The Abyss/NPCs/Stool\|Stool]], a [[Myconid\|Myconid]] sprout
- and [[Topsy and Turvy\|Topsy and Turvy]], deep gnome twins originally from Blingdenstone in the Underdark.

The “party” includes a color cast of characters:

- [[The Abyss/The Party/Dandelion\|Dandelion]] is a pretty-boy changeling, whose default look includes red hair and green eyes.
- [[The Abyss/The Party/Dagon Zapeir\|Dagon]] is a blue dragonborn paladin, with a magnificent beard and hails from Olympus. 
- [[The Abyss/The Party/Micah Clearstrength\|Micah]], a pale-skinned human barbarian, also has red hair and piercing green eyes. 
- [[The Abyss/The Party/Shanti Halydove\|Shanti]] is a dark-skinned elf with amber eyes that appear golden under the light. Crowned with think curly, off-white hair, she appears shy but upon closer inspection she’s discerning .
- [[The Abyss/The Party/Seraphine\|Seraphine]] the Brave and Beautiful is a tall human with fair skin, long blonde curly hair, blue eyes, manicured nails, rosy cheeks and lips. <span class="spoiler">She’s basically Sleeping Beauty but can punch.</span>
- and [[The Abyss/The Party/Gark\|Gark]], a “drow” with dark hair — he’s strange looking for an elf, even more so for a drow.

<div id="velkynvelve" class="map"></div>
<p class="caption">Map of Velkynvelve</p>

Gark speaks with [[Derendril\|Derendril]], the most menacing-looking prisoner, attempting to scope out the bigger individuals in order to escape. Unfortunately the quaggoth’s elvish is strange, thus the language barrier dissuades Gark from interacting with him further.

Dagon learns pp was working for the main houses in [[Menzoberranzan\|Menzoberranzan]] working in one of the outposts while on a raid. He got captured because he was accused of killing one of his own. He doesn’t believe he did it — keyword being “believe.”

>[!info]- Matriarchal Rule
>Females are the top figures in drow society. At the head of each house is someone who is a shrewd business operator, a skilled tactician, a high priestess of Lolth, and probably also a merciless assassin with blood on her hands. Unlike with many other races, female drow are typically taller and more robust than males.
>
>In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow — either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can’t be priests, nor can they rule a house.

Sarith clarifies that we are slaves, not prisoners, as we will be sold to the drow in Menzoberranzan. While we have been here for a day, he has been here for a week.

Shanti scopes out the slave pen and finds a sharp rock as an improvised weapon. Plotting, she asks if anyone has anything in their hair, hoping to make an improvised lockpick. She goes through Seraphine’s hair retrieving a well-hidden hair pin, and they formally introduce themselves. 

As she attempts to pick the lock, four drow approach the cell from afar. One is [[The Abyss/NPCs/Jorlan Duskryn\|Jorlan]], a maimed drow warrior — his face appears melted and scared, and his right hand is missing his index finger and thumb as though damaged from acid.

>[!info]
>There are 12 drow, five elite warriors — one is Ilvara’s lover, [[The Abyss/NPCs/Shoor Vandree\|Shoor Vandree]] — a junior drow priestess ([[The Abyss/NPCs/Asha Vandree\|Asha Vandree]]), and a senior drow priestess (Ilvara).

Jorlan informs us that we need to earn our keep. Pointing to our group of six, we follow the two drow to the quaggoth den, which they order us to clean. The residing [[quaggoth\|quaggoth]] growls at us. As we “clean,” the two guards immerse themselves in conversation. Dandy attempts to use magic, but his shackles begin to glow. He then attempts to distract the guards by loudly tripping as Gark attempts to also cast [[minor illusion\|minor illusion]]. 

Shanti finds a flawed carnelian gemstone (10 gp), though during her search notes that one of the guards sounded disappointed.

Dagon asks Grak about the guards’ conversation, however the “drow” busied himself by playing in the mud and concocting ways to escape. They agree to help one another, and Grak once again attempts to use magic, casting [[Mage Hand\|Mage Hand]]; the mud masks the glow of his restraints 👀👀👀, however the ward cancels out his magic. Feeling useless, he gives up. 😅

Dagon huddles the group together to form a plan, though this triggers the guards. Shanti caresses Dandy as a ploy to grant him Vigilant Blessing, though it initially disgusts him. She gives him a well deserved glare.

Once again, pretending to clean, Seraphine finds a gold coin, stuffs it in her chest, and gives Dandy a look 😏. He also finds a cold coin and returns her advances, copying her actions, though the coin drops back on the floor. He hands it to Shanti, who rolls her eyes and kicks him. 😒

Micah finds a large bone shaped like a [[dagger\|dagger]] (the first <span class="party glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span> of the game 🥳).

As Dagon attempts to break his shackles with his Breath Weapon, Dandelion and Seraphine flirtatiously approach guards. Shanti joins them to add to the distraction, directing Dandy. This prompts Dagon and Miach to successfully sneak behind the guards instead. 

>**Guard 1:** What do you want?
>**Shanti:** Well it’s more of a ... what do you want? 😏
>**Guard 1:** (blunt) I want y’all out of here. 😒

They’re awaiting the pickup from Menzoberranzan.

Despite their approach, drow aren’t interested in races other than their own — they especially hate other elves. Shanti continues to press, as Dandy shapeshifts into a female drow and dances in response, hoping to seduce them by appealing to their tastes. 🎶 *You know my hips don't lie* 🎶

<span class="sticky">Dandy’s performance grants Dagon Bardic Inspiration, however not even that can save someone from two consecutive Natural 1’s ... 🫠</span>

Dagon attempts to take the keys but the guard catches on, and Shanti falls on him, attempting to strangle him with her restraints. This incites a fight.

Micah successfully grapples the second guard, and proceeds to beat him silly (another <span class="party glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span> 🥳). Dandy uses this opportunity to swipe the keys, and free himself. One by one, we toss the keys around, freeing ourselves as we attempt to fight off the armed guards and quaggoth.

Seraphine attempts to grapple the quaggoth, but the creature proves to be a bit studier (DM rolled a <span class="anti glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span> and rolls another later on 😒). Dandy successfully knocks out the strangled guard, rendering him unconscious from [[Vicious Mockery\|Vicious Mockery]]. “You have a face only a mother can love!” 🫢

Unfortunately, the scuffle alerts the nearby guards and one goes to get the priestess. Shanti arms herself with the fallen guard’s weapons, ready to defend herself and the others. Gark immediately gives up and plays dead as more guards arrive. 😂 Seraphine hides the stolen keys (<span class="party glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span> 🥳), then uses her manacles as a flail (1d6 + STR mod) against the quaggoth.

Dagon then ✨politely✨ grabs the keys from Seraphine’s chest to free himself.

Once [[The Abyss/NPCs/Ilvara Mizzrym\|Ilvara]] appears, accompanied by [[The Abyss/NPCs/Asha Vandree\|Asha]], [[The Abyss/NPCs/Jorlan Duskryn\|Jorlan]] and [[The Abyss/NPCs/Shoor Vandree\|Shoor]], she suggests we surrender. 

>**Ilvara:** I’ll give y’all an opportunity to lay down your arms.
>**Gark:** I’m already ahead of the curve. 🤣

We take a moment to share a look and surrender peacefully, though a few of us attempt to hide weapons, etc. Dandy, still disguised as a female drow, unsuccessfully attempts to convince them “she’s” not a prisoner. In an act of defiance, Shanti remains standing as the others kneel.

<span class="floaterR">
	<img alt="S&M" height="200" src="https://i.gifer.com/WqS7.gif">
</span>

Ilvara takes a moment to heal her guards, claiming she now has to punish us. Dandy lights up at the prospect 😏😂. She casts [[ray of sickness\|ray of sickness]], though it misses the changeling who grovels. The guards restrain and take us back to our holding cell, not knowing Dagon hid the stolen keys in his mouth (<span class="party glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span> 🥳). She then leaves us to pick one from the group to die, thus beginning the “interview process.”

[[The Abyss/NPCs/Jimjar\|Jimjar]] comments on our appearance as some of us look a bit roughed up. Dandy announces to the other prisoners that Ilvara ordered us to choose one of them to die as punishment, though the deep gnome recognizes “her” deception. Gark rats “her” out regardless. He then points out that choosing is meaningless as Ilvara will choose regardless.

[[The Abyss/NPCs/Stool\|Stool]] introduces himself, telepathically expressing he wishes to go home. Gark attempts to offer up Stool’s life, though Shanti threatens to choose him, peeved about his lack of initiative during the fight. She comments he’s useless and he willingly agrees. 😅 Micah takes a liking to [[The Abyss/NPCs/Stool\|Stool]], and adopts him. 

[[Topsy and Turvy\|Topsy and Turvy]] are stealthy. Micah kneels down at their level and inquires on how they were captured. Topsy, the more sociable twin, confesses exploring  and scavenging outside of [[Blingdenstone\|Blingdenstone]]. They’re mostly peaceful, but will fight if necessary.

Micah approaches [[The Abyss/NPCs/Ront\|Ront]] who aggressively flexes and boasts about his strength. His group was attacked on the surface, fighting [[Eldeth\|Eldeth]] and her group. He strongly dislikes the dwarven female. Micah then questions Eldeth, who attempts to be coy until Shanti calls her out. 

Dandy points out we now have a scout, though Shanti gets *justifiably* angry at Dandy who knows she’s a proficient scout. He’s the reason she’s been imprisoned, and she reveals she knows her way around the Underdark. As they bicker one-sidedly, Micah ignores them and voices that the drow are attempting to pit us against one another.

Dandy then asks [[Eldeth\|Eldeth]] who has been imprisoned longer and who’s useless. She admits it’s nearly impossible to gauge one’s capabilities and usefulness considering the circumstances. She doesn’t know much about the others.

Micah asks [[The Abyss/NPCs/Stool\|Stool]] if anyone present is untrustworthy. Without skipping a beat, he states, “I think everyone here is amazing.” ♥️ The two express their trust in one another. 

<span class="sticky green left">Petition Stool for group mascot. 🍄<br><br>He stays. 🥰</span>

While prolonging our decision, Eldeth steps up to take the blame. Shanti warns her that the priestess will kill her. “I care for others more than myself.”

In the event she dies, she asks us to give her pendant, a gold necklace with a red gem in the middle, to her family in Gauntlgrym. The cleric kisses her forehead and prays — “May [[Celestian\|Celestian]] protect you and yours always.”

In response, Micah huffs and broods, disapproving the entire situation. Shanti goes off into a corner to pray more.

[[The Abyss/NPCs/Shoor Vandree\|Shoor]] and [[The Abyss/NPCs/Jorlan Duskryn\|Jorlan]] knock and command everyone to line up against the wall. [[The Abyss/NPCs/Ilvara Mizzrym\|Ilvara]] comes in and taunts us. 

>**Ilvara:** (condescendingly) Have you chosen the one will die?
>**Shanti:** (under her breath) Can it be you? 😒

We remain quiet, ignoring her. Excitedly, she picks [[Eldeth\|Eldeth]], [[Sarith\|Sarith]], and [[Shuushar\|Shuushar]] — Eldeth attempts to speak up, but the priestess shuts her down. Dandy attempts to rectify the situation, but she ignores us. The guards then hurl Eldeth and Shuushar over the ledge as giant spiders descend upon them to feed, though take Sarith elsewhere. 

Ilvara smiles, “I think we’ll have a different punishment for you.”

Now left alone to rest, Seraphine attempts to gather her new friends together for a cuddle pile, though Shanti declines, admitting she’s too old for the young girl. The prisoners rest, somewhat hopeful as they now have a few tricks up their sleeves.
