We wake first thing in the “morning,” noticing we’re being denied our meals — possibly a continuation of our punishment. Dandy complains about the rock he used as a pillow. Seraphine craftily implies she could have offered him a pillow if he had asked. 😏

[[The Abyss/NPCs/Buppido\|Buppido]] gets in Shanti’s face as she rummages through her hair to locate Seraphine’s hair pin. She goes around him ready to pick the lock. He bombards her with questions, though she ignores him, giving him a quick look. Noticing her escape attempt, he states she needs his help. She quickly dismisses him.

Dandy approaches and helps Shanti look around for guards as she works on the lock. Strangely, there aren’t any guards around. Across the bridge, there is light — the guards are occupying the tower. Shanti slips out of her manacles, dislocating a few bones in the process. She returns her attention back to the lock.

Gark asks Shanti to release him from his shackles. She refuses, expressing how unimpressed she felt about his lack of initative in the fight the day before. He threatens to scream for the guards, but she could care less. [[The Abyss/NPCs/Jimjar\|Jimjar]] calls them out for bickering and suggests they should be attempting to escape instead. She agrees and continues to pick the lock.

Jimjar also asks to be released from his shackles, though she bluntly tells them, “I slipped out, why can’t you?” Dandy agrees with her. Shanti continues pointing out that the hair pin is a gamble, implying she would rather try on the door. Jimjar’s interest piques at the word gamble and he attempts to start a bet with Shanti, who dismisses him. She’s no fun. 😛

[[The Abyss/NPCs/Derendil\|Derendil]] goes up to Gark and telepathically inquires of his earlier conversation. Gark attempts to vilify Shanti, who he claims refuses to help the others escape. Derendil boasts about his royalty, professing he can lead us all out of Velkynvelve.

Eventually, Shanti unlocks the cell door as a few individuals gang up on Dandy for his comment on being the most graceful. Noticing the opened door, Gark nearly riles everyone up to run out. Shanti shushes them, hoping they stay quiet and asks if they can get out of their manacles. Dagon announces he still has the keys from the fight in his mouth.

Two guards and [[The Abyss/NPCs/Jorlan Duskryn\|Jorlan]] approach from the tower with [[The Abyss/NPCs/Sarith Kzekarit\|Sarith]] in tow. Shanti hides in the darkest corner, utilizing her abilities to blend in with the shadows (<span class="party glitch"><span>Natural 20</span><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20</span> 🥳). The guards throw Sarith’s dead body in the pen. “Let this be a warning to you all,” Jorlan states. He ignores the unlocked gate, telling everyone to await Ivara’s next punishment (chores), though locks it as he and the two guards walk away. 🤔

[[The Abyss/NPCs/Stool\|Stool]] is saddened, telling Micah that Sarith saved him. She comforts the small myconid before he makes a fuss.

[[The Abyss/NPCs/Jimjar\|Jimjar]] telepathically tells us our stuff may be stashed in the guard tower (area 10). Shanti attempts to direct everyone to quickly unlock their manacles in regards to Dagon’s confession. A few of the prisoners seem skeptical at first, questioning whether it’s a good idea to escape now. Dandy suggests they escape around nightfall, however it’s always dark in the underdark. As we discuss escaping, [[The Abyss/NPCs/Buppido\|Buppido]] screams, revealing he’s crazy. Micah slaps him.

>**Gark:** We could hang out here.
>**Shanti:** No we don’t want to *stay* here in the Underdark. The Underdark is not a place to just *dwell*.
>**Gark:** We could decide to be slaves.
>**Dandy:** It’s dark in here!
>**Shanti:** Dandy, darling, you can see.
>**Dandy:** Oh my eyes were closed, sorry. 😅😋

Shanti reminds everyone she knows her way through the Underdark, though her communication skills are poor. <span class="spoiler">Honestly, she thought it was implied that everyone would follow once the cell was open.</span>

[[The Abyss/NPCs/Ilvara Mizzrym\|Ilvara]] and [[The Abyss/NPCs/Jorlan Duskryn\|Jorlan]] approach and enter the cell. They choose Dandy, Gark, and Micah to come with them. Gark attempts to persuade them that he’s weak and not built for manual labor, however that’s only eggs them on. “That’s too damn bad,” they as they push him forward. Worried about Stool, Micah seems hesitant to follow, until she feels a “reassuring” pebble hit the back of her neck — Shanti’s attempt to let her know she’ll watch him.

Dandy, Gark, and Micah are led through the Guard Tower to the next stalactite, where they pass a shrine to [[Lolth\|Lolth]], the drow goddess, and go down into Ilvara’s personal quarters. She sits with both [[The Abyss/NPCs/Shoor Vandree\|Shoor]] and Jorlan at her side. Shoor orders the three prisoners to clean her room, though Ilvara personally orders Dandy to clean her boots. Frustrated, Micah walks over and spits on her boots, stating it’s a start, which Ilvara strangely appreciates.

Gark notices a fancy, heavy chest that holds Ilvara’s important items. Dandy attempts to wipe her boots with her rug, and Shoor hits him with the pommel of his sword. The three drow discuss the late shipment — she’s eager to send us to [[Menzoberranzan\|Menzoberranzan]] to elevate her status. Jorlan grips his sword, glaring at Shoor.

Back in the cell, the others attempt to make an escape plan while unlocking their manacles. Dagon assigns Shanti as the guide, though she admits she’s used to going alone, somewhat concerned with a larger group. Dagon suggests she scout ahead and they follow, to which she adds that’s the whole point of a scout. Seraphine proposes that Topsy and Turvy could join the elf on her scouting. [[The Abyss/NPCs/Jimjar\|Jimjar]] expresses how interesting he finds us.

While searching for improvised weapons and interesting trinkets in the slave pen, Shanti hears a strange buzzing sound — it’s foreign to the Underdark. She recalls strange things have been happening in the Underdark related to something else.

Jimjar once again asks about the plan, mentioning the twins. Shanti conveys that she and the twins could retrieve armor and weapons from the guard outpost ahead, especially if they studied the guards routine. She voices some concern for the large group.

[[The Abyss/NPCs/Topsy\|Topsy]] attempts to join the conversation, though [[The Abyss/NPCs/Turvy\|Turvy]] pulls her aside protectively. Shanti lowers herself and assures the deep gnome she will do everything in her power to make sure they are both safe. The twins talk in private. Shanti then addresses Stool, stating Micah would kill someone should he not remain safe. He wants to stick with the group, though Shanti warns him to stay clear of her as she’ll get into the most trouble.

[[The Abyss/NPCs/Ilvara Mizzrym\|Ilvara]] dismisses the other three prisoners, and [[The Abyss/NPCs/Jorlan Duskryn\|Jorlan]] sends them on our way back to the slave pen. On his way out, Dandy spots a lift near the barracks and southern watch post. Following the waterfall beneath the spider webs is a large pool that flows against a large clearing. There may be several escapes to choose from. 

Jorlan barely notices a few of us don’t have our manacles as he returns Dandy, Gark, and Micah. He closes the door without saying a word. 👀👀👀 As the drow elite warrior walks away, Gark spills the beans — he’s upset he’s no longer favored by Ilvara and despises Shoor. He warns us of the upcoming, though late, shipment to [[Menzobarranzan\|Menzobarranzan]]. Dandy reveals his observations for potential escapes.

<span class="floaterR">

	<p class="caption">Fall Damage 😛</p>
</span>

[[The Abyss/NPCs/Buppido\|Buppido]] express his concerns with using the lift — someone would need to stay behind. Fortunately, Gark and Shanti know a few other “safer” exits to the north, south and west. Gark suggests jumping down the waterfall, reiterating one Dandy’s initial ideas. Shanti notes that it may be dangerous, though Jimar is all for it. Hoping for the best, the cleric mentions the exits — they would have to find a way down, but it would be “safe.”

Gark is willing to take sacrifices the others to test this theory, though Jimjar suggests using the webs to lessen our fall meaning we may need to take out a spider or two if we disturb the web. 🕸️🕷️🕸️ Gark then mentions he could manipulate the water with [[Shape Water\|Shape Water]], creating stairs for us to descend down. Dandy points out that the strange elf seems inconvenienced by his own suggestion, despite the spell being a cantrip.

[[The Abyss/NPCs/Derendil\|Derendil]] wraps himself around Gark, claiming the sorcerer would make a good servant since he’s an elvan prince. Shanti attempts to push Gark and Derendil on each other, quickly segueing into getting everyone’s equipment back. The delusional quaggoth then states Shanti would make a good servent too. Ready to argue, Shanti mentions her own status, possibly implying she is related to royalty/nobility. Derendil admits from Nelrindenvane, a grand elven kingdom Shanti has never heard of before despite her exile. *Side eye.* Dandy ignores him.

Micah asks what they’re doing, and Shanti asks Dagon for the keys so everyone can be free. Once free, the barbarian safetly ties [[The Abyss/NPCs/Stool\|Stool]] to her back. Thinking back to the gold coins he and Seraphine found, Dandy suggests they bribe the guards. Everyone dismisses that idea — even crazy Buppido thinks it’s dumb. <span class="spoiler">In normal circumstances, it would have worked ... maybe, with a decent Charisma (Persuasion) check. However, this is the drow we’re talking about. 😞</span>

Gark suggests we just escape without getting our items, not quite understanding the dangers of the Underdark. <span class="spoiler">Also ... my guy, without components or an arcane focus, you can’t cast spell. Please get your equipment. 🥲</span> With the keys in their possession, Shanti offers to scout ahead looking towards the guard tower where the guards are currently playing cards. She unlocks the cell door and returns the keys to Dagon.

<span class="floaterL">

</span>

Dandy hears buzzing coming from the south, informing the group. 🚨🚨🚨 Shanti brings it up as well, having heard it earlier, and admits it’s not normal in the Underdark. Going south is out of question due to the high risk.

The south passage would take us to [[Gracklstugh\|Gracklstugh]] (28 days), the  north would take us to Menzoberranzan (the drow city, 26 days), while the west leads to the [[Darklake\|Darklake]] (8 day) where the [[kuo-toa\|kuo-toa]] dwell . Recalling this information, Shanti recommends the group goes west. But first, scouting and retrieving equipment!  

The elf cleric then asks Topsy and Turvy if they’re up for some reconnaissance. Topsy expresses her excitement, though her brother seems reserved. Shanti suggests they either split up or rely on numbers, and they choose the latter. The group then plans on creating a distraction so that the scout team can make their way safely to the guard tower.

>[!spoilers]- Metagaming and Planning
>While on break, we offered a few funny suggestions out of character. Mikayla mentioned sacrificing one of the NPCs who would distract the guards. Majesty immediately offered Buppido with no hesitation. 😬 Unfortunately, while he may not “be all there,” it doesn’t mean he’s also stupid. The idea is not scrapped though, just need to look for another NPC.

As we discuss plans, we all look to [[The Abyss/NPCs/Ront\|Ront]], who has been staring at his reflection and flexing. He appears to be in higher spirits not that [[The Abyss/NPCs/Eldeth Feldrun\|Eldeth]] is gone. Wanting to include the other prisoners in our discussion, we open the floor for suggestions. Shanti approaches Ront with the prospects to provide muscle, however the orc is flakey, making him somewhat useless. 

She moves on Micah, recalling her brilliance the day before, and asks how she feels about taking out a couple of guards. The human barbarian admits she cannot do it alone, and Shanti admits she has a few spells in her arsenal, though she would be more useful with a ranged weapon. She asks about everyone’s skills and abilities, building an assessment of the team.

<span class="floaterR">

	<p class="caption">Tick Tock ...</p>
</span>

Suddenly, the buzzing loudens. Screams and the clashing of weapons fill the chasm, as the drow and quaggoths fight against chasmes and vroks. Concerned, by the appearance of these creatures, Shanti declares they have a distraction. We leave our cell and make our way to the tower. Unfortunately, a few guards notice us escape, though a couple are ordered to return us to our cell. <span class="spoiler">Gotta acknowledge the DM’s <span class="glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span> 🙄</span>

Approaching, one shoots Shanti with his crossbow, and she retaliates by blinding them, throwing the rock she found and casting [[light\|light]] on it (<span class="party glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span>  🥳). Seraphine and Micah run up to support her preparing for melee. Gark finally shows off his magical prowess with [[Magic Missile\|Magic Missile]], blasting off the drow’s armor a bit. Dagon strategically buffs Micah with [[Shield of Faith\|Shield of Faith]], while Dandy casts [[Tasha’s Hideous Laughter\|Tasha’s Hideous Laughter]], causing one of the guards to go prone, and then telling the group to throw him over the bridge. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽. 

The other drow attempts to hit Micah, but hits the rope of the bridge. 😅 Shanti robs the prone drow, going for his [[crossbow (hand)\|crossbow (hand)]], and runs towards the door. Seraphine successfully takes his [[shortsword\|shortsword]]. Micah rages and yeets the prone guard over the bridge. He ends up caught in the webs, laughing hysterically — fortunately for him, the spiders are full from the night before.

The remaining guard swipes Micah, but Seraphine intercepts his attack leaving the barbarian unscathed. Gark blasts the guard with [[Magic Missile\|Magic Missile]] in his face, sending his unconscious body over the bridge. Looking around, the elven sorcerer notices the other guards are getting the upper hand against the swarm of strange creatures. He keeps quiet. We quickly run inside the guard tower and barricade both doors, though Shanti nearly flips out on a distressed [[The Abyss/NPCs/Ront\|Ront]].

Seemingly safe, we look around for our stolen items, finding a locked chest that is trapped. Micah offers to use her dagger, though considering some of us are wounded from the recent skirmish, we aren’t too keen in getting more hurt. Shanti successfully finds the key among the guards’ regular supplies. We successfully retrieve our items and change as the guards bang against the zurkhwood doors.

>[!info] Zurkhwood
>Despite being a fungus, it is a source of wood in the Underdark.

<span class="floaterL">
	<img alt="" height="250" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8c651b4261f7f7deaa5fc871920ad17f/tumblr_ppup6w2LKi1sqtgdgo1_r3_400.gif">
</span>

We quickly discuss upcoming plans, possibly deciding to go west toward the Darklake, though they’ll need to jump. Dandy attempts persuades Ront to hold the door while the others hyping the orc up. Derendil helps hold the door. Dandy whispers to Shanti who pinches his cheek in response. “We can just leave them.” 👀 The cleric pushes more heavy objects against the door, hoping to lighten the load on the two strong prisoners. She then shares her darkvision, lengthening a few choice individuals’ vision out to a range of 300 ft.

As Shanti attempts to describe the jump, [[The Abyss/NPCs/Buppido\|Buppido]] leaps off the bridge into the spider webs, gracefully maneuvers himself into the water (<span class="glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span>). He emerges from the water into the clearing and runs towards the opening.

>I can’t believe I’m saying this: follow that crazy derro. Let’s go!
>
>— a flabbergasted Shanti

We all follow suit, managing to land on the web upright, though Dandy gets stuck (<span class="anti glitch"><span>Natural 1</span>Natural 1<span>Natural 1</span></span> 😳). Shanti goes to help him before the spiders notice them. Seraphine remains in the pool waiting for the stragglers as the rest convene with Buppido. Something wraps around her ankle, attempting to pull her down. Hanging upside down, Dandy’s quick thinking allows a jaunty tune to escape his lips to give the fighter inspiration. She cuts whatever grabbed her and quickly gets out of the water.

A spider notices Dandy and Shanti struggling and begins to approach them. The cleric successfully cuts the bard out of the web, and leans them back to fall into the water. Jimar, Topsy and Turvy easily escape, jumping down to follow us. Ront runs out, scared out of his wits, and jumps off the bridge and Derendil follows. Unfortunately, they are hit by bows on the way down.

Buppido waves us down to enter the west cave. A [[chasme\|chasme]] lands in front of our exit, being shot down by one of the drow. It turns its attention to us. Upon inspecting it, Dandy realizes it’s a demon, but cannot speak its language.

>**Dandy:** Can anybody speak demon?
>**Shanti:** You mean Abyssal?
>**Dandy:** Abyssal!
>**Shanti:** (coy) Maybe ...
>**Dandy:** Shanti can you?
>**Shanti:** (ashamed) Yes ...
>**Dandy:** I want you to tell him, “Hey, we mean no harm! We’re just passing by.”
>**Shanti:** (quickly): No.
>She aims her bow at the creature.
>**Dandy:** No?!
>**Shanti:** It’s a demon!
>**Dandy:** Maybe demons can be persuaded!
>**Shanti:** That’s a devil!
>**Micah:** (done) Oh my gosh ...
>**Dandy:** No?
>**Shanti:** No!
>**Micah:** You might actually have a chance to save us!
>**Shanti:** No, it’s a demon! 👹
>[...]
>**Mikayla:** Can I roll to see if he’s mad? Like, what’s his vibe? I want to vibe check him.
>**Jasper the DM:** It just got shot from the sky, you ask it!
>**Brittney:** He’s *pissed!*

Despite Shanti being uncooperative, Dandy casts [[Tasha’s Hideous Laughter\|Tasha’s Hideous Laughter]] on the demon, allowing everyone to dash past it and escape. [[The Abyss/NPCs/Ilvara Mizzrym\|Ilvara]] notices our escape and yells out to her subordinates to go after us once dealing with the onslaught. Micah yells out, “Suck it bitch!”

Shanti flips the drow priestess off and winks, before disappearing into the cave ready to make another trek through the Underdark.
