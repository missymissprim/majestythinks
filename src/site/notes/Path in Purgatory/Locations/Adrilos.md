## Other
The southeastern nation known as the [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Dualis Empire\|Dualis Empire]] is made up of a series of city-states that all work against each other for power. The major cities involved in this power struggle are [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Chasmia\|Chasmia]], [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Spenwald\|Spenwald]], [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Hidela\|Hidela]], [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Port Laska\|Port Laska]], [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Frenevid\|Frenevid]], [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Lindhaven\|Lindhaven]] and [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Azvon\|Azvon]]; a few smaller villages remain independent but many end of the territories of these larger cities.

North of Dualis is the elven forest nation called [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Lath‚ÄôLindel\|Lath‚ÄôLindel]]. The elves who live here are secretive and rarely leave their home except to trade goods with their neighbors.

The northernmost nation on the continent is called [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Dinaea\|Dinaea]] and is home primarily to the dwarves. It is separated into three cities that have been in a civil war for many years.

To the west of Dualis lies the marshy nation of [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Gorin\|Gorin]]. This land is primarily inhabited by the less ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù races of the world and is rife with internal conflict, though some groups manage to organize themselves well enough to strike their neighbors for land and resources.

To the far west and spanning the western edge of the continent lies the desert nation called [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Falivar Desert\|Falivar Desert]]. As no other nations have learned how to survive this vast desert, the Falivarians remain very mysterious, almost acting more as a folk tale than an actual country.

## Religion
Within Adrilos, there are 10 primary deities known as the Ascendant. They are:

1. [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Vala\|Vala]] - The god of the sun, righteousness, and pride (Averill‚Äôs diety, worshipped as militaristic in Chasmia, seen as rigid; a lot of farmers worship him as kindness from the sun, nutrition and light for crops to grow, a god of order and contrasts from Ursa, represented as a white and gold dragon ‚Ä¶ deep guttural voice that emanates all around)
2. [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Ursa\|Ursa]] - The goddess of the moon, subterfuge, and humility (Myron‚Äôs deity)
3. [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Illian\|Illian]] - The god of wisdom, time, and seasons (Fen‚Äôs deity)
4. [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Gaelira\|Gaelira]] - The goddess of life, nature, and balance (Elliot‚Äôs diety)
5. [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Sendri\|Sendri]] - The god of storms, might, power, and the forge (Moradin‚Äôs deity)
6. [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Winora\|Winora]] - The goddess of the seas, trade, commerce, and contracts (related to Twin one way or the other)
7. [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Laf‚ÄôLoran\|Laf‚ÄôLoran]] - The god of music, art, and trickery (chaos and freedom, looked at as a trickster god, freedom of expression)
8. [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Carilla\|Carilla]] - The goddess of death, ceremony, and fate (Ashissa‚Äôs deity)
9. [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Baraban\|Baraban]] - The god of knowledge, magic, and innovation
10. [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Kriva\|Kriva]] - The goddess of justice, vengeance, and tactics
