The Story Tracker is a note-keeping tool to help report important information about the characters, their accomplishments, and upcoming quests.

The [[Nameless Ones\|Nameless Ones]] met in Spenwald having coincidently converged in the Ascendant Temple, where they unexpectedly fought a bodak ‚Äî an undead creature. Further investigation led to discovering rumors of a coup and the involvement of a mysterious group known as the [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Void Walkers\|Void Walkers]]. Following various clues, the Nameless Ones have been traveling across Adrilos in hopes of uncovering and stoping the Void Walkers plans.

For more detailed information about our adventure, read the <a class="internal-link" href="#session-toc">session summaries</a> below.

##### Gem Hunt
- [ ] Baraban‚Äôs Sapphire (currently with Lord Kasper)
- [ ] Illian‚Äôs Diamond (currently with Cadogan)
- [ ] Winora‚Äôs Pearl (currently with Cardinal Divitae)
- [ ] Sendri‚Äôs Cobolt (possibly with Keyne in Gorin)
- [ ] Vala‚Äôs Amber (possibly in Chasmia, somewhere in Dualis)
- [ ] Ursa‚Äôs Opal (currently in Spenwald, Ascendant Temple)
- [ ] Kriva‚Äôs Ruby (somewhere in Dualis)
- [x] Gaelira‚Äôs Emerald (currently with Fen)
- [ ] Laf‚ÄôLoran‚Äôs Geode (currently with Cardinal Volu)
- [x] Carilla‚Äôs Onyx (currently with Ashissa)

##### The Champions
1. Baraban ‚Üí Zossa???
2. Carilla ‚Üí Ashissa
3. Gaelira ‚Üí Elliot
4. Illian ‚Üí Fenmarel
5. Kriva ‚Üí ???
6. Laf‚ÄôLoran ‚Üí ~~Zuri???~~
7. Sendri ‚Üí Moradin
8. Ursa ‚Üí Myron
9. Vala ‚Üí Averill
10. Winora ‚Üí Twin

##### Theories
1. The Void Walkers may need sacrifices to open the Void Gates. [[Path in Purgatory/Session Notes/Session 008 - 04092021\|Session 008 - 04092021]] (The dread lord of fortune, Mammon, keeps open the gateway in exchange for the souls of the young prince as previously discussed; should the young royal not surrender his soul by the first snow or the fragment of power returned in whole, Cardinal Divitae shall instead give of their own soul to complete the deal.)
2. The fey may have been used and sacrificed to possibly open a portal to the Feywild. [[Path in Purgatory/Session Notes/Session 036 - 10212022\|Session 036 - 10212022]]
3. The name ‚ÄúEmpty One‚Äù could possibly refer to his never-ending hunger for chaos, power, and destruction, or could be a void of emotions, etc. [[Path in Purgatory/Session Notes/Session 008 - 04092021\|Session 008 - 04092021]] & [[Path in Purgatory/Session Notes/Session 036 - 10212022\|Session 036 - 10212022]]
4. The Void Walkers obviously have high connections in all the major cities. They may glean information from the Dawn Martyrs, the Chasmian intelligence organization. Regardless, everyone is compromised to a degree. [[Path in Purgatory/Session Notes/Session 036 - 10212022\|Session 036 - 10212022]]
5. Zossa and Zuri may be champions of Baraban and Laf‚ÄôLoran respectively. Zossa was attacked by the Void Walkers early on while traveling to Frenevid. [[Path in Purgatory/Session Notes/Session 010 - 05072021\|Session 010 - 05072021]]. He may be a threat to the Void Walkers.
6. The Void Walkers are creating conflicts between cities/kingdoms/empires as a distraction. <span class="spoiler">What if the bloodshed represents the sacrifices needed to open the Void Gates.</span>
7. Lord Kasper may be a Void Walker ... baseless assumption, however everyone is suspect. 
8. The Minotaur is either a bishop or Cardinal Fero ...
9. The Void Gates are located underground ‚Äî recall Frenevid, Dham Auram, and now Aden Vala. <span class="spoiler">It‚Äôs possible that they all connect and open a larger portal, which will release the Empty One.</span>

##### Things of Note
1. 300 years ago, the Felgrand family took over Chasmia, and Duke Elnaril has been in charge of Felindra since then. ü§î

Unfortunately, he gets caught by Averill, who shows him no mercy. Morning comes, and Averill explains last night‚Äôs shenanigans to *sober* Fen. Corinne joins the conversation, and the conversation reveals she may be interested in Averill. Despite all the antics, the Nameless Ones prepare for their encounter with Luthais, eventually finding themselves in an unpopulated Aden Vala. They locate the underground tunnels and fight with Duke Elnaril and four hags.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Hoping we stalled his plans, we assign Moradin to scry on the Sovereign, and to our detriment, he has revived Inara. Fen and Corinne seek help from the recovering Sovarin and learn about the underground systems under Aden Vala. She gives Corinne a painting that reveals a clue to the entrance, however, Corinne takes it upon herself to examine the painting alone with her expertise, despite Fen and Averill trying to rationalize with her. After a few heartfelt conversations and apologizes, we solidify our plans and prepare for our inevitable encounter in Aden Vala.                                                                                                                                                    |

With no immediate plan or destination, Twin begins his five day cat nap, while the rest of the party separates to have a few heartfelt conversations before succumbing to sleep. Moradin and Averill discuss the logistics and true meaning of friendship, and Ashissa and Myron discuss his brutal backstory, strengthening their bond. Corinne snoops and prods both the ship and the party to learn more about her situation, unfortunately angering Fen in the process, but finding a friend in Ashissa. While asleep, Twin receives a vision about Divitae and Theo, and Moradin confronts Graz‚Äôzt, receiving help from Sendri via Divine Intervention, who then comforts him with a visual of his father‚Äôs whereabouts. |

Our loud discussion piques the curiosity of a roaming Corinne who claims to have been sent by Sovarin, and she joins the party. Luthais ‚Äúinvites‚Äù us to the ritual chamber and demands that we restore the stone Twin destroyed. Not liking their options, the Nameless Ones and Corinne fight Cardinal Volu, making sure to thwart his plans by killing Inara. He is able to escape with the fairy, and the party nearly escapes the city as he sends a hoard of mindless elves their way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
