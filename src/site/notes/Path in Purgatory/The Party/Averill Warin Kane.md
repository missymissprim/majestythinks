Averill is a young soldier who once longed for adventure, but seems reluctant in many aspects. While he prefers to go solo, he has found himself amongst a rambunctious group (the [[Nameless Ones\|Nameless Ones]]), traveling around the continent in order to stop the [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Void Walkers\|Void Walkers]]. Though he originally cared little for the gods, Averill‚Äôs journey has led him to become a paladin of [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Vala\|Vala]], who has shown an interest in the fighter.

## Description
Standing 6'2" with dark expresso-like skin, Averill is surprising limber despite being broad. He has heterochromia, inheriting both his father‚Äôs piercing icy blue and his mother‚Äôs warm brown eyes ‚Äî a strange feature he shares with his youngest sister. His graying hair is styled in short dreadlocks, paired with a fade and thick goatee. While he looks intimidating and imposing, he‚Äôs strangely quiet and bashful.

### Personality
Polite and respectful, Averill is a reluctant leader, and participant especially when he feels the situation is too dangerous for his friends. He believes his current stoic demeanor allows him to remain unnoticed, but lately as felt a rekindling of rebelliousness. 

Averill is true to his word, and will protect those in need, fighting for their cause. Though in doing so, he appears to have quite the temper, which [[Path in Purgatory/The Party/Moradin Thraudmere\|Moradin]] found out all too late after drugging Fen, attempting to manipulate her to forget her husband (see [[Path in Purgatory/Session Notes/Session 041 - 01132023\|A Plethora of Intentions]]).

### Motives/Goals
At one point, the eldest Kane wanted an exciting life of adventure, exploring world outside of [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Riverna\|Riverna]] and secretly desiring to become a hero. Unfortunately, his dreams died during the [[Gorin incursion\|Gorin incursion]], leaving him a shell of his former self, broken and dismayed. Many years would pass before an inkling of resolve and fervor would reignite, pulling the soldier forward.

Now while traveling alongside the [[Nameless Ones\|Nameless Ones]], he hopes to see their mission to the end, strengthen his relationship with [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Vala\|Vala]] to become a just paladin, and prove to himself that he is worthy.

### Values/Ideals
Averill abides to the following ideals:

- **Aspiration.** I seek to prove myself worthy. (Any)
- **Freedom.** Everyone should be free to pursue his or her own livelihood. (Chaotic)
- **Justice.** I can‚Äôt stand people being treated unjustly. I do whatever it takes to stop injustice and those who flout the law. (Lawful)
- **Respect.** All people, rich or poor, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. However, I will give respect to those who give respect to me. (Neutral)
- **Responsibility.** I do what I must, holding myself accountable for my words and actions, and obey *just* authority (Lawful).
- **People.** I am committed to the people I care about. (Neutral)

### Bonds
Averill fights for and protect those who cannot do so for themselves; though, his family is the most important thing in his life, even when they are far from him.

### Flaws
His hatred for his enemies is blind and unreasoning ‚Äî often leads to a ‚Äúsetback.‚Äù

## Backstory
Mundane, quiet, and hella boring ‚Äî this holistically described the small village of [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Riverna\|Riverna]]. It was there that Averill Warin Kane‚Äôs humble origins began with what he considered to be an extremely ordinary life within the [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Dualis Empire\|Dualis Empire]]. In his frequent spare time, he secretly fantasized about adventure and immersed himself in books detailed with life and excitement that existed outside of his four walls. Daring tales of knights, heroes, and legends fueled his childish dreams to become a great hero of the people, and establish himself as thrill-seeking explorer. 

His parents‚Äô, [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Czar Shannon Kane\|Czar]] and [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Maylis Eudora Kane\|Maylis]] Kane, wealthy disposition allowed Averill and his five younger siblings to live comfortably and exposed to their socialite lifestyle ‚Äî or rather made them victims to it. While their parents participated in every possible social function amongst the elite ‚Äî especially the [[Cloudcrest family\|Cloudcrest family]] who rule the town ‚Äî Averill took it upon himself to watch over his siblings, becoming their protector and defender. He grew up fighting, and refined his talents by defending himself and his siblings against bullies, mimicking his folk-tale heroes. Unfortunately, his gallant antics often got him into trouble whenever he ‚Äúdamaged‚Äù his parents reputation with another ‚Äúsetback.‚Äù (He will neither admit nor deny, but one skirmish ended in the Cloudcrest heir acquiring a bloody nose, a newfound respect for the Kane siblings, and a friendly rivalry.)

</span>

In his late adolescence, Averill joined the Chasmian army, the [[Dawn Striders\|Dawn Striders]], at the behest of his grandfather and parents (especially his mother) in preparation as the next head of the [[Dubois family\|Dubois family]]. He was forced to comply when he felt that his private relationship with [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Zuri Malika Bonnet\|Zuri Bonnet]], a talented violinist and childhood friend, was being threatened, along with his siblings‚Äô futures. He received harsh lessons in discipline, teamwork, respect, and humility. Led by his sense of duty and grandeur of heroism, Averill prepared to fight the [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Gorin\|Gorin]] forces who made it far past the border and attacked his homeland that displaced his family, hoping to help reclaim Riverna. During his days of training ‚Äî particularly after a visit from his younger brother, [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Quintus Alexander Kane\|Quintus]], an academic who researches [[dunamis\|dunamis]] and [[dunamancy\|dunamancy]] ‚Äî Averill‚Äôs mind became clouded with weird dreams and visions of dangers to come; and in one instance of clarity, an unknown being appeared and warned him of the upcoming battle.

Despite the warning, he and his fellow cadets arrived unprepared for true horrors pertained to war, and nearly lost their lives in attempt to reclaim their homeland. Somehow with his quick thinking, newfound ability, and blind hatred, they were able to turn the tide of the battle in their favor, however, the Gorin leader, a [[Cardinal Fero\|minotaur]] with large curved horns and carvings of a six-pointed star, escaped. Averill held onto a memento from this battle, the Minotaur‚Äôs left horn, as a reminder of his failures, and used it as inspiration to decorate his heraldic sign: a skull with a dagger through it, representing the promised doom he wishes to bring upon his enemies. He eventually earned himself the rank of Captain, after years of service. 

Currently off duty, Averill decided to live out his dream as an adventurer making coin here and there, but found more satisfaction in genuinely helping others during his travels. Though in his wanderings, he hopes to find answers about the being who visited his dreams, concerned about the future of the world he now knows.

>[!dream]- Averill‚Äôs Nightmares
>The sky. Just as the sky is blue, reflecting off the ocean, here it‚Äôs red; angry and hungry, as the sun fades to black. Or sometimes it‚Äôs black. No stars, but the blood moon fills the sky, staring and waiting. When there is a star, it‚Äôs alone and gets choked by the abyss.
>
>Blood. Each dream has blood. Whether it‚Äôs his own, from the piles of dead bodies surrounding him, or from the shallow endless sea beneath his feet, there‚Äôs always blood.
>
>Sometimes, he bleeds, paralyzed and unable to move. Or he drowns when his body gives way. Or the bodies ... the bodies ....
>
>The bodies, sometimes silent, other times screaming in terror or whispering of horrors. There‚Äôs too many. Too many voices to pick up one message besides: ‚ÄúDanger.‚Äù ‚ÄúWar.‚Äù ‚ÄúSacrifice‚Äù.
>
>When they‚Äôre not stiff and rotting, they‚Äôre pulling and pulling and pulling, suffocating the life from his lungs. *Sacrifice*. 
>
>Sometimes they rise, weapons in hand, ready to attack either each other or him. *War*. 
>
>Sometimes they run and hide, trampling over one another, and piling, piling and piling. *Danger*.
>
>They all lead to death. But it never makes sense.
>
>Then there‚Äôs the figure. It never helps. Just stands. Watches. Waits.
>
>It‚Äôs hard to discern who or what the figure is, due to the nature of the dream, but the focus is around what the figure is holding.
>
>A sword ‚Äî long with runes covering the entirety of the black blade. The hilt and pommel are covered with gold, and the pommel is cast in the form of an open dragon claw as though it was intended to hold something, but its grasp remains empty. Waiting ...
>
>Despite the scenery and imagery of the blood and bodies, the blade always remains pristine.
>
>Only once has the figure reached out. It was night before his first battle. And he bled and for once ... he saw his shadow.

### Chasmia
Averill joined the military at the behest of his grandfather, patriarch of the [[Dubois\|Dubois]], a family known for their military connections and status; his [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Czar Shannon Kane\|father]], who also participated in the military for some time; and his [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Maylis Eudora Kane\|mother]], who is vying for his position as *the* firstborn son. Forced to abide their wishes, Averill sought to make the most of it and prove himself.

Before the incursion, Averill was quite boisterous and unafraid to fully express himself. He didn‚Äôt care too much about the political climate of [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Chasmia\|Chasmia]], but knew enough to navigate it well. A lot of individuals took a shining to Averill ‚Äî seeing the pompous kid trying to prove himself time and time again, especially Colonel [[Mattias Valerin\|Mattias Valerin]]. He would later take Averill under his wing and train him accordingly. 

On the opposite end of the spectrum, Captain [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Garon Nero\|Garon Nero]] patronized and demeaned Averill, planting seeds of self-doubt that took culmination after the battle in [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Riverna\|Riverna]]. He continuously attempted to prevent the young soldier from rising in the ranks.

Averill‚Äôs outlook on life took a turn for the worse after the PTSD-experience with Gorin‚Äôs forces, seeing his friends and comrades die. This lively, outgoing person began to shrink and die on the battlefield as he processed the destruction around him. Simultaneously, with a combination of merit and nepotism, Averill was promoted, eventually rising up in rank to Captain of the Noon District, which would have been a ‚Äúgood job‚Äù considering he showed aspects of leadership and drive. However, because of what happened, he sees things differently.

In the moment of awakening his echo (shadow) in a blind rage, he cut off the minotaur‚Äôs horn and [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Nhylena Palathei\|Nhylena Palathei]], soon to be the Champion of Onias, repulsed the beast. While she was a primary force in driving the Gorin forces away, she recognized Averill‚Äôs potential and recommended he be promoted.

### Leaving Riverna
Currently off duty, Averill has spent time near [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Port Laska\|Port Laska]] to make sure his youngest brother, [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Richard Mar Kane\|Richard Mar]], has safely settled in his new home. Now free to adventure, he traveled toward [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Spenwald\|Spenwald]] to find answers about the occult and to discover more about the gods (see [[Path in Purgatory/Session Notes/Session 001 - 11272020\|A Bodak, a Coup, and a Murder]]).

Several weeks before, his family informed him that the [[Cloudcrest\|Cloudcrest]] family‚Äôs youngest son [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Reed Cloudcrest\|Reed]], who was to be dedicated to the priesthood in [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Chasmia\|Chasmia]], was recently murdered under strange circumstances. The boy was only five (5) years old and there were occult markings at the site. The town blamed a pair of ‚Äúweirdos,‚Äù who were living outside of the town in a small hut. One man and one woman ‚Äî fitting a similar description to [[Path in Purgatory/The Party/Ashissa Pythan\|Ashissa Pythan]] and [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Dornan Dral\|Dornan Dral]]. There weren‚Äôt any other specifics besides that.

<span class="floaterR">

	<p class="caption">Void Walker Symbol</p>
</span>

Because of his official ties to the Chasmian law enforcement, Averill was allowed to see the crime scene . Etched in the ground where the body was found was a six pointed flowery star; pretty similar to the one he remembers on the horn of the minotaur. He draws it in his journal for future reference .

### Oath Tenants
Averill was considered to be Lawful Good, however, he is willing to do questionable acts against the law if he feels the end goal will benefit the greater good. He may be lean towards Neutral Good, or rather he's leaning towards the middle ground, having been chaotic as a juvenile and going to the other extreme as an adult. Regardless, having given his oath before Vala, Averill follows the following tenants:

1. Laws, rules and authority are set in place to keep order, peace and serve a directional function for society. Though they are meant to be respected and adhered to ... rules can be broken and respect disregarded if deemed absolutely necessary. ‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Äú‚Ä¶ order and law are absolutely necessary to assure good, and that good is best defined as whatever brings the most benefit to the greater number of decent, ‚Ä¶‚Äù ^[Gygax, Gary. _Advanced Dungeons and Dragons: Dungeon Master‚Äôs Guide._ TSR:1979. and Gygax, Gary. _Advanced Dungeons and Dragons: Player‚Äôs Handbook._ TSR:1978.]
2. Defend the people through any means necessary, even if it goes against laws, so long as it advocates justice and doesn't sacrifice the greater good. _The end justifies the means._ 
3. When all else is lost, be their hope, their champion ‚Äî fight for their freedom and pursuit of happiness ‚Äî even in the face of overwhelming odds. But don't be blind with revenge, lest you lose yourself to the darkness, and suffocate their light. 
4. Should the enemy lack mercy or empathy, spare none for them. Overwhelm and shatter their victory.
5. Do not shoulder every burden. You are not alone, even when it appears that way. (This one is new.)

> 
> His echo has an armor class of 18, 1 hit point, and immunity to all conditions. If it has to make a saving throw, it uses his saving throw bonus for the roll. It is the same size as him, and it occupies its space. On his turn, he can mentally command the echo to move up to 30 feet in any direction (no action required). If his echo is ever more than 30 feet from him at the end of his turn, it is destroyed.

> 
> ***Second Wind.*** Once per short rest, Averill can use a bonus action to regain 12 (1d10 + 7) hit points.
> 
> ***Solar Plexus.*** As a bonus action, Averill can activate this effect for one minute. While active, he is unable to call upon his echo while gaining the following benefits:    
> - He now has resistance to radiant and necrotic damage.  
> - Melee attacks against him have disadvantage as various echoes obscure his enemies vision.
> - Melee attacks he makes deal an additional 4 (1d8) of radiant or necrotic damage (your choice).
>
> Once per turn, Averill can expend a use of Unleash Incarnation to make an additional attack on any one creature within 60 feet as though he were making the attack in melee. All of the damage in this attack is either radiant or necrotic damage (your choice).
> 
> Utilizing this divine power racks his body with solar energy, crippling him for a short period of time. When this ability concludes, make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 10 + 1d10, rolled by the DM). On a success, you manage to shrug off the effects of this ability. On a failure roll a d4. On a 1, Averill is [[blinded\|blinded]]. On a 2, he gains the [[poisoned\|poisoned]] condition. On a 3, he takes a level of [[exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. On a 4, his hit point maximum is reduced by half. These effects last until he takes a long rest.
> 
> ### Reactions
> ***Manifest Echo: Opportunity Attack.*** When a creature that Averill can see within 5 feet of his echo moves at least 5 feet away from it, he can use his reaction to make an opportunity attack against that creature as if he were in the echo‚Äôs space.
