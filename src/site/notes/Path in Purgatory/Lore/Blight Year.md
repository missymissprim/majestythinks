# The Blight Year

A cataclysm of destruction that took place 1,000 years ago where nearly all the races and history were wiped out, possibly as a direct result when the gods left [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Adrilos\|Adrilos]].

The Blight Year occurred after the gods disappearance. All manner of calamities happened across the continent, most races were on the brink of extinction. Conversations and arguments took place between the various deities around a table with various degrees of tension. A decision needed to be made, and the process was slow and difficult. There is not agreement amongst the gods. 

The land had a gentle golden glow that completely rips away as destruction pours out in various places on the continent.

According to [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Sovereign Luthais Avadorn\|Sovereign Luthais Avadorn]], the world was doomed the Blight Year took place as the last surge of power escaped the land and opened up space for the Primordial Planes to come crashing in.
