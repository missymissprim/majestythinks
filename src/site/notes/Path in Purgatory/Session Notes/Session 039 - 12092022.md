>Twin’s consciousness is temporarily displaced into Myron’s body, and the Nameless Ones begin to make plans to retrieve his own body. Our loud discussion piques the curiosity of a roaming Corinne who claims to have been sent by Sovarin, and she joins the party. Luthais “invites” us to the ritual chamber and demands that we restore the stone Twin destroyed. Not liking their options, the Nameless Ones and Corinne fight Cardinal Volu, making sure to thwart his plans by killing Inara. He is able to escape with the fairy, and the party nearly escapes the city as he sends a hoard of mindless elves their way.

</div></div>


We find ourselves in the Verdant Hall in the vacant city of Felindra. The original green coloration of the Verdant Hall is browning, dying wildlife, and a slight oder fills the air — fortress like structure made of plant-life that is decaying. The group (sans Averill) originally didn’t find the necrotic source, though assumed Bishop Revnon was the cause ... it is magic related.



The group begins to describe the space/city to Corinne from about a month and a half ago, before the mass exodus to Aden Vala. They did search the second time around (a week ago), but didn’t find anything valuable, other than Zossa and Revnon.

Ashissa becomes anxious mid-conversation, a flight-or-flight response, a sense that something is about to take her life, a feeling she has felt before … before everything went black. Averill checks on Ashissa, asking if she’s okay, but she doesn’t say anything. Corinne checks on Sovarin, her drunken stupor has lessened some, barely. She asks if there’s any spells we can use to “fix” her, and we admit that we unfortunately have to wait despite previous efforts (Lay on Hands), pointing out that Zuri took time as well. 

Corinne asks us questions, wondering why Luthais was irate with us. Twin and Moradin lie through their teeth (nothing new), suggesting that Luthais has gone senile, and that he’s blaming others for his mistakes and failures. 

We begin to walk and talk towards the dock to get on the boat (the Guilded Wind) — Moradin carries Twin, while Averill caries Sovarin. Corinne officially introduces herself to Myron, striking conversation by asking if sharing a consciousness with Twin was strange. An unfortunate, unpleasant experience ...

Twin takes credit for his new “feat,” bringing up the rabbit incident again. Myron and Averill asks for more details, and Fen describes their encounter with Elliot, who’s consciousness was in a rabbit. He led them through a scary forest where they killed a scary, zombie woman. She wasn’t attacking them, just coming towards them ... apparently looking like a zombie. The old woman was an elf who may have been trapped in the forest for centuries, she then fell over (lie), though Moradin interjects stating the girls are lying as they attacked the woman first. It was suspicious. Distraught, Averill asks what happened while he was gone and they mention a dragon. 🤦🏽‍♀️ 

Hilariousness ensues as the conversation continues. Corinne draws the randomness of the groups misadventures as we talk about every weird encounter (the Shadowfell, etc). Averill walks away faster, and Fen calls him out, saying she’s got the boat. 

She begins to describe her studies, proud of her advancements, and is upset her friend is not excited. Averill apologizes for his irritability and social ineptitude. She mentions that it’s better than the Feather of the Archaeopteryx, which prompts Twin to ask Averill to return the feather. Averill, feeling silly and wanting payback, points out Twin can’t move and creates distance between them. 😛 Twin orders Moradin to chase, and Averill calls out, “Who’s interesting now?!”

Fen then goes through the process of readying the boat — out of her component pouch, she pulls out an origami boat. She begins to manually unfold it and through weird magic, it transforms into our boat on the water. We inform Corinne how we got the boat, mentioning our encounter with Bishop Degaros, the Void Walkers, and their hierarchy. Averill shows her the symbol from his journal and she recalls seeing it in some of Luthais’ writings. She continues to draw several interpretations of our misadventures.

Twin claims to be captain, and suggests new passengers should bow and ask permission to board, though we pay the limp cat no mind. Corinne curtseys regardless, and Averill sardonically welcomes her to the group. Fen points out we just met her, but upon Moradin suggesting she’s prettier than her, welcomes her with exuberant enthusiasm. 😂   Averill asks where Corinne would like to place Sovarin, near sunlight — thankfully we have a few quarters to spare. Ashissa sails us away from port, Myron helps her as she helms.

We then discuss where we will travel. Ashissa mentions that Fen wanted to visit Belda Sil, though Twin suggests we remain out of sight for about five days (no more exhaustion). However, we don’t have five days if we should return to Aden Vala and confront Luthais again, considering the portal opens in about three ... now two days. Though we may have greatly affected his timeline by killing Inara and destroying the engraved stone. Averill reminds them that the Void Walkers are quite resourceful.

Corinne gets a bit confused with our vague terms and we remind her that Luthais wanted us to restore a stone with a six-pronged symbol (the symbol of Graz’zt). Moradin gives her a visual by showing off his brand, which still burns. Averill suggests smiting it 😈 We consider the possibilities, but upon mentioning friendship, Averill calls him out and asks why he didn’t say anything.

Corinne asks about seating and the subject jumps to getting her a comfortable room with no windows as she would not like to look at the sea — sea sickness, perhaps? We decide to move Sovarin to the barracks with a porthole so she can get sunlight, and Corinne next door to the barrack with no porthole.



Twin instantly falls asleep in the captains quarters (who knows what our hierarchy truly is but not worth arguing over lol), getting a head start on lessening his exhaustion levels. We all begin to go our separate ways, but not before putting Ashissa in an awkward situation with Myron. 

Corinne explores the ship and the layout (kitchen, bathrooms, etc.) — even more so than us (lol). She finds a lavatory that opens with a lever to the ocean, a kitchen space, two untouched storage spaces adjacent to the captain quarters. Underneath one of the crates, she finds a trap door and opens it. She goes down lower into the ship. Along the floor and sides are a series of red tinted runes and converge underneath the captain’s quarters. It’s evocation in nature channeling “wires” though the bottom of the ship and directs upwards to the captains quarters — possibly the propulsion of the ship.

The runes continue upwards to the helm within the captain’s quarters obscured by the bed. There’s a repeating pattern, but hard to discern as she continues to follow the runes and wood grain of the ship.

Corinne and Ashissa strike up a conversation, to which Corinne admits she’s never been on a ship. Ashissa hints a bit at her backstory upon mentioning hating water. Corrine asks about Fen’s recent brush with death, but Ashissa has very little answers other than it’s new but related to the gems. She notices the gem shard (Carilla’s Onyx) amulet, there’s a strong presence about it. Ashissa received it from Lord Winry Selek in Lindhaven, who believed Ashissa was trustworthy (lol). Corinne realizes she’s trying to hide some information through shiftiness and a jovial nature. Ashissa comments on her claws and warns her not to talk to Moradin about forging, or rather anything. She also suggests she cover up, warning her about his perviness. 🚩🚩🚩

Her henna designs are temporary, she likes art and does it herself for fun, preferring the versatile canvas and short-lived material. They begin discussing tattoos. Ashissa’s arm sleeve depicting a forest silhouette, an owl, and the moon, ending with her protective shield tattoo (geometric skull) on her hand — a vision of a dark forest (Shadowfell), Carilla (owl), etc. She then discusses Zuzu, insinuating some mental healing, and they get a bit vulnerable as she discusses her time in the Shadowfell.

Corinne begins to like Ashissa, who confesses the party is cool, we’re just overly cautions. Corrine points out that Myron is somewhat familiar (Ashissa gives them the side eye 😂). She mentions a gift, and Myron’s eyes widen in recognition. He asks if she spent time in Spenwald, to which she has traveled and may have been in Spenwald and spotted Myron when he was there. She asks where he hails from and they discuss Gorin for a bit. When she gets a bit personal, he redirects, suggesting they have the conversation another time. She tells him that out of the entire group, he appears to be the safest to have a conversation with. She notices she’s intruding on their “alone time,” and continues to spy on the rest of the group.

Moradin and Averill have an intense conversation about friendship, that Moradin hopes they keep between themselves in confidence — Corinne is off to the side listening in on their conversation, which Averill clocks. Moradin admits he had “friends” but not *friends* — “none of your best friends, consider you their best friend.” It’s hard for him to make lasting relationships; the party is the longest relationship he’s ever had, and he doesn’t want to risk losing it. When the brand came about, he was scared. Averill gently points out that he could have told him so he could help, especially since they share more in common than Averill would like to admit.

Somehow the conversation turns to potential romantic interests for Moradin, leaving Averill with mental whiplash on how that tangent came to be, especially when Moradin says, “I’m glad you see the potential in Corinne.”  Averill puts his foot down in regards to Fen, telling Moradin once again to back off. Moradin argues how could we allow a friend to live with grief, to which Averill points out they both have to live with grief ... it’s unfortunately a part of life, and has no timeline. He suggests that he allow Fen to process this on her own and come to him when the time is right. He’s not hearing it 😭

Moradin then compares her circumstance to blacksmithing, to which Averill angrily points out that she’s not a project. He tries to suggest that blacksmithing and metalworking has emotion and story. Averill rationalizes that he appreciates the friendship he has with Moradin, while admittedly hanging on a thin thread, and would like to keep it in tact. Moradin promises not to hurt her, and he brings up the poems of grief he has in his possession. Averill tries to explain the complexities of grief, but to no avail, and realizes they’re not going to agree.

Moradin believes he and Averill make a good pair, despite indirectly hurting his so-called friend, and states they keep each other in check ... even though that feels very one sided at the moment. Averill continues to push, but in doing so, becomes too frustrated and the exhaustion of the day begins to hit him. They go back to the word *friend,* and Averill hints at his upbringing and status. They somewhat agree to disagree, and go to bed, but not before Moradin offers Averill fish. Averill hates fish (lol).

As they prepare to go to bed, Moradin doesn’t notice Corinne, but Averill gives her a look. Moradin knocks on Fen’s door and quickly scurries to his room upon noticing Averill glaring at him down the hall.

Ashissa and Myron have some time together. 😏 Ashissa asks about his voice; he’s not a full vocal capacity yet. Myron got closure, but hasn’t completed what he’s trying to do. He begins to explain his backstory, beginning with the small fishing village in Gorin (Ichivar) where he spent most of his childhood fishing with his father. Primarily a tiefling village, they were ostracized and were’t trusted being the only humans. 

Myron was into a lot of mischief and made fast friends with the chief’s son, Teadrop. They were around the same age and grew up together in secret. While adventuring, they saw some figures in the distance, Teadrop wanted to go home, but Myron’s curiosity was piqued. They saw a Minotaur 🤯🤯🤯 accompanied by an orc (who appeared to be his attendant 👀👀👀), and a hooded figure (maybe human). The boys were spotted, but the three strangers weren’t hostile and spoke with them. What seemed to be strange questions at the time happened to be them gathering information about the village, its strength, numbers, resistance, etc. 

<span class="sticky">So ... hear me out ... the Minotaur is either a bishop or Cardinal Fero ... <span class="status">YIKE™</span> but also 👏🏽 </span>

They returned to their father’s. Teadrop’s father was upset believing that the strange humans on the outskirts were selling information to a nearby village. They uprooted Myron’s family, and beat his parents to death in front of him. His father communicated telepathically with Myron for the first time, sharing knowledge of their cursed bloodline that he had hoped to keep hidden from him. They then punished Myron via ritual performed on those deemed traitors whereupon he received his silvery scars … then left for dead. When he closed his eyes and open them again, a raiding party had gone through the village. Any who were’t slain were taken. Because of all that occurred due to him opening his mouth, he vowed not to do so again … he was thirteen.

Ashissa attempts to comfort him, redirecting the blame as he was only a child, and realizing he may have come to such conclusions now that he’s speaking. She suggests killing the raiders (lol) — Myron has entertained the idea. She even volunteers the party to kill them for him. Myron mentions he’s done some scouting and found that the minotaur and his base is in the village of Sanvar … 👀👀👀 

Myron then tells Ashissa about his curse. He pushed it away for a long time, not wanting to deal with it, but a very long time ago, one of his ancestors made Laf’Loran angry (Valyron, a skilled jeweler, who went after Ursa 😂). They were doubly cursed, they were sealed out from the realm of dreams … and if he were to produce an heir, destined to have an only child, it will be a son and when he turns thirteen, Myron will die. Ashissa attempts to find a silver lining. Though, he does hint that he hasn’t really pursued romance (she’s so happy lol), but would like to pursue a romantic relationship (and more) with Ashissa. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 She points out that she’s not sure how children would work considering she lays eggs.

Determined, he tells her he will break his curse and they agree to figure it out. She asks if he’s had a chance to contact Laf’Loran, which is near impossible without dreams. All he sees is the endless void and can only hope to wake up the next day. She offers to put a good word in for him the next time we encounter Laf’Loran, and Myron brings up his amulet. 

Myron pulls out his greatsword, it looks old and dingy. His eyes flash silver and the blade looks perfect and has a subtle silvery glow to it. It was forged long ago by his ancestors and passed down for generations. It has stockpiled the wishes of those before him — one of the last gifts from his father.

Some Tieflings have returned and rebuilt the village (Ichivar). They helped him, not recognizing him.  As their conversation dies down, they enjoy one another’s company, sailing alone on the open sea, with no direction in mind .

Corinne knocks on Fen’s door, and Fen states she’s busy. (Unfortunately, Moradin messed with her door before, so the lock is now compromised. 🚩🚩🚩) Regardless, Corinne breaks into her room and Fen is pissed, ready with [[Resources/Spellbook/Shocking Grasp\|shocking grasp]]. Corrine entirely misreads the situation dancing around the room, attempts to calm Fen to no avail as she asks for forgiveness and arcane knowledge. Fen suggests if she truly wanted to make amends that she’d leave. Corinne acknowledges she forgets certain social cues, and performs an elaborate exit after leaving tea for her, but Fen violently throws it at her door.

Corinne then goes to the kitchen to make itching powder (... SUS 😒) however, she’s too tired. As she walks by her room, she hears Moradin’s door unlock and creak open. 🏃🏽‍♀️🏃🏽‍♀️🏃🏽‍♀️ She begins to set a trap at her door just in case, though not before checking on Sovarin.

Twin finds himself in *deep* sleep. He’s drifting through a series of dreams, reliving a series of recent events, and sees Laf’Loran lazily floating by. He seems to be looking past him for a moment. Cracks his fingers a bit, and the dream shifts. He then finds himself looking through the perspective of someone else. He’s in a room with a view out to the ocean. He quickly discerns that he is looking down the city of Dham Auram from the guilded palace, he sees groupings of fiendish entities canvasing the streets. He then sees a stout feminine figure pacing (Divitae), and she’s angry.

There is a finely made metal structure with a dais, hovering above is a black orb of energy — seems similar to the ritual chamber in Aden Vala. Tendrils writhe from the orb, a deep sense of hunger eminates from it. Whoever Twin is looking through is amazed, a nihilistic sense of peace overcomes them, along with confusion, fear, etc. Divitae steps forward to the orb, around her neck is Winora’s pearl. A pained expression comes across her face, energy pours out of her and the pearl as flows into the orb. She shudders as the outflow stops and she rights herself.

“I’ve grasped all that I can O’ Empty One …” and coughs blood. She makes eye contact with “Twin.”

“You must go and find him, *now*.” 

Out of his mouth, “Twin” answers, “Very well, I shall return.” This may very well be Theo. Twins vision then turns to darkness.

Moradin finds himself in a sensory deprivation space, laying in water surrounded by pitch black, but he can make out his form. He rights himself as the darkness shifts and turns into a Hall of Mirrors. He sees reflections of himself everywhere.  The space has a decent opening, around 30 ft in diameter.

Around the corner of the mirror, he sees a tall figure (7½–8 ft tall), fleshy purple skin, wearing a jet black robe. On each hand he sees six fingers, horns curve from his temple. A strange fiendish allure exudes from the figure. On his back is a large sword, jet back in make, gnarled and curved in weird ways with hooks and branches that extend from it. He points out Moradin hasn’t held his side of the agreement, to which Moradin recognizes his voice (Graz’zt) and they formally introduce themselves.

Moradin asks him why, or rather “What about me drew your attention?” Graz’zt admits that his discerning eyes are drawn to those with strong *desires*, and Moradin is known to give in to such passions and desires. Moradin states that life isn’t worth living, if not enjoyed, to which Graz’zt agrees that is his own philosophy and that the two are on the same page. 🤦🏽‍♀️ Moradin argues he’s not too sure about that.

He wants something specific from Moradin and to help *his* Volu (Luthais). While Volu could take care of it himself, he’s a bit busy and tells Moradin to fix what Twin broke. Graz’zt doesn’t go into the specifics of what it can do, but good news for Moradin and his father (he threatens), is that it’s replaceable. If he fixes it, Graz’zt agrees to tell him the exact location of his father. Moradin asks for assurance. Graz’zt waves his hand and Benson appears chained and unconscious in a dark space. Moradin then asks him for assurance that he and his associates will not get in the way when he goes to retrieve his father — Graz’zt can only promise for himself, and will do what he can with the others. 🙄 

Moradin asks him what is required. Graz’zt swiftly cuts off his own hand with his sword and gives it to Moradin. His hand then begins to turn into stone as he shakes his wrist while another hand grows. Out of the ground a metal dais appears with a black orb with tendrils coming out. Moradin is overcome with a deep sense of need, hunger and emptiness. *This desire of all these things and difficulties that are making everything so awful, broken and fractured ... could all just go away.* The presence is astounding and eclipses the presence of the gods … 😰

Graz’zt instructs him to dip his severed hand into the orb, hand it back to him, and voilà, Moradin gets the information he wants. Moradin begins to rack his brain as to why Graz’zt cannot do it himself, possibly needing a willing participant.

“If this honors you, guide my hand towards it.” Moradin prays to Sendri, and casting [[Resources/Spellbook/Commune\|commune]]. He reaches out to Sendri, feeling the familiar electrical energy, but the orb is attempting to pull at the energy. He can’t seem to connect to Sendri and uses Divine Intervention (7 🥳🥳🥳). What was beginning to wane, lightning strikes and overwhelms Moradin resisting against the force. He asks Sendri to guide him, and the energy pulls his hand back. He casts [[smearing smite\|smearing smite]] at 6th level on the hand … it disintegrates. 🫢 

Graz’zt is angry and the tendrils reach out, but Moradin immediately wakes in a cold sweat. The brand is now gone. A last bit of good will, a bolt of lightning strikes him and his consciousness is taken across the land, moving toward Gorin. He finds himself in the middle of a series tent-like huts before he is in a dark space. His father is chained, staring at the ground. There is a huff in the corner of the room, as a large and imposing figure, the Minotaur stands. The village of Sanvar fills his mind. Moradin attempts to call on his father, but no response and settles to check on his health — not in the best of shape, but not malnourished, a couple of bruises, but not outright torture.

Moradin’s consciousness returns and thanks Sendri, claiming he’ll never abandon him. Sendri returns the sentiment. He passes out.

We all rest, though Myron and Ashissa are tired from manning the helm. A new day is before us.
