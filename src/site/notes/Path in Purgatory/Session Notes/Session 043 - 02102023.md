>[!session] [[Path in Purgatory/Session Notes/Session 042 - 01272023\|Session 042]]
>The Nameless Ones continue through the underground beneath Aden Vala, hoping to encounter Sovereign Luthais. Along the way a few of the members are plagued with minor curses in order to open an intricate door. Once opening the door, they find a distraught Luthais, who then becomes possessed and gruesomely transforms into his patron, Graz’zt. The Nameless Ones fight the demon lord despite a few setbacks, and successfully defeat him.   


</div></div>


>[!info]
>[[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Sovereign Luthais Avadorn\|Luthais]] was never a devout follower of [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Laf’Loran\|Laf’Loran]], a trickster deity over revelry, however the transition made it easier for his people to be affected by [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Graz’zt (PP)\|Gra’zzt’s]] influence — going unnoticed and becoming more palatable over time. While Laf’Loran was not totally on board, there is morally-gray area when dealing with such a being.
>
>Recall [[Path in Purgatory/Session Notes/Session 042 - 01272023#^journal\|Volu’s Journal Entry]].

Having dealt with Volu possessed by Graz’zt and Averill dealing the finishing blow, the Nameless Ones find themselves victorious, watching Luthais’ physical alteration recede and his form immediately dissolve. We each feel an intense energy pulse through the air as the void orb collapses on itself as it thrashes — an intense hunger and desperation pours out of it. (Throughout the encounter, there was a crushing, overwhelming presence crushing down every single one of our movements, mentally as though moving through molasses.) Moradin quickly cuts off Luthais’ head and casts [[gentle repose\|gentle repose]].

As the body hit the ground, we all hear the loud clang of Laf’Loran’s geode follow suit. In response to the pulse of the void energy, it gives off a sizable amount of energy on its own, as the death throws of the void desperately draws some of its divine energy before collapsing.

Averill reaches for the geode, proceeds to heal Fen, and goes blind as his boon deactivates. (Asshisa starts us off strong with the first roll of the night: a lovely <span class="anti glitch"><span>Natural 1</span>Natural 1<span>Natural 1</span></span> 😅)

<span class="floaterR">

</span>

Corinne immediately notices a figure aloft, laying lazily near the dais looking around taking stock of our group. Smug, Laf’Loran winks at her. 

>**Lexie:** I bursted a blood vessel, staring at nothing. 😂
>**Crystal:** I’m just [looking in the] opposite direction.
>**Majesty:** I can technically only see Fen, but Averill’s just kind of crying.
>**Chris:** I’m just singing the Lumberjack song!

Myron immediately begins to attend to Fen, who begins to cough up blood. Ashissa hands Averill a [[Potion of Healing (Greater)\|Potion of Healing (Greater)]].

>He just — was that — was that eight or ten packs? Wha-what — was that a ten pack on him? How do you fit all those on that torso? 🤣
>
>— Ashissa, in front of her boo no less

While everyone is distracted, Corinne approaches the trickster, who then speaks up. He’s been watching the whole time through the geode, which he considers an inconvenient place. Averill calls out to him, implying he can fortunately hear the god.

Corinne asks whether he’s in or out of the geode, curious by his mere presence. He answers cryptically with a resounding two yes’s — he has more freedom than some of the other ascendant as his virtue is of his domain. She pointedly asks if he’s astral projection, to which he responds is the closest, yet simplest, explanation to describe the situation.

>[!info] Avatars (Holy Possession)
>The concept is quite new considering the gods were present on the earth before the [[Path in Purgatory/Lore/Blight Year\|Blight Year]], thus they didn’t need one. It can be argued that the potential to do so as existed, but never done in practice. 
>
>It could also be said that a mortal could embody and become a vessel of a deity within the world.
>
><div class="definition"><h3>avatar</h3><span class="pronounce">\  ˈavəˌtär \</span><hr><p><strong>:</strong> a manifestation of a deity or released soul in bodily form on earth; an incarnate divine teacher<br><strong>:</strong> an incarnation, embodiment, or manifestation of a person or idea</p></div>

Corinne casts [[Mage Hand\|Mage Hand]] (green and purple) to inspect the geode. Averill senses the hand but asks for details of his surroundings, which Fen describes. He assures Ashissa the blindness is normal, though it could have been worse. The soldier gives the geode to the spectral hand, and Corinne studies the newly acquired god gem.

The geode has various surfaces — rough and rocky in some areas, and smooth around others with a swirling green and purple coloration. Looking closer inside, she sees a lot of idealized landscapes, larger than life that appear in and out of existence, and figures alongside them — they appear to be the quintessential versions of some of her nightmares and dreams she had in the past.

Fen asks Laf’Loran if he and the others are aware about the plan to return their consciousness back to Adrilos, basically asking for his consent. She elaborates, asking if it’s a good idea.

>**Averill:** Consent is important.
>**Moradin:** Very important. 🚩🚩🚩
>**Laf’Loran:** Can I answer your question *super* cryptically?
>**Fen:** I would be disappointed if you didn’t.
>**Laf’Loran:** I would really like it for you to bring the gems to the towers.
>**Averill:** That was clear.
>**Ashissa:** That was not cryptic at all! Do you know what “cryptic” means?
>**Averill:** That was a very good, straightforward answer.
>**Fen:** I know — it makes me a little bit nervous.

Ashissa asks that he answer differently, though he creeps her out with his suspicious smile. He mentions her “fun” nightmares and she directs his attention to her symbolic tattoo. He comments on the craftsmanship and interpretation, though argues he would/could have done a better job. He flicks his hand and the scenery animates on her arm, offering to teach her a command word to replay the effect. The word is “pickles.” 🥒 😂

She asks whether anyone can just say the command, and has Averill repeat it. It doesn’t work at first, until after Laf’Loran tells him to try again. Excited, Ashissa plays with her new feat.

Corinne attempts to cast a spell ([[detect thoughts\|detect thoughts]]) that even Averill senses. Laf’Loran warns her, “You do not want to know what goes on in here. [...] But—but, I respect the attempt. We’ll talk later.”

Assuming the god is in an answering mood, Averill attempts to ask Laf’Loran about talking to [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Vala\|Vala]], offering a favor if necessary. “I’m going to answer your question super indirectly too, by not even answering your question.” 😅 He continues to address Corinne, mirroring a dance she knows, dancing towards her and taps her on the forehead. A puff of green and purple energy surrounds her, granting her a boon. 

Ashissa reassures Averill and tells him to just talk to Vala on his own. Averill expresses he needs to see Vala in person again, though isn’t sure how to go about it. She reiterates her previous point and adds that he needs to make his intentions known. He thanks her, voicing how he admires her relationship with [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Carilla\|Carilla]], which she admits was a work in progress.

An hourglass manifests next to Laf’Loran. (Not sure who, but a <span class="tink glitch"><span>Tink</span>Tink<span>Tink</span></span> was announced.) He announces he has very little time, and to quickly ask our questions. Ashissa calls him out, knowing he’ll disappear as soon as we ask. Averill jabs that he already asked his question.

>**Moradin:** I know a one night stand when I see one.
>(Pause)
>**Laf’Loran:** You’re going to find out.
>**Ashissa:** I predicted this dude to the T!
>**Fen:** It was worth checking.
>**Laf’Loran:** (to Ashissa) I simultaneously like you and don’t like you.
>**Ashissa:** I get that a lot.

Laf’Loran bamfs out. ✌🏽 Ashissa tests out her tattoo and it still works. Averill notes that it sounds cool in theory, which prompts Fen to grab his arm to guide him. He informs everyone he just needs to sleep it off, listing off the other effects of his ability. He explains he had it not too long before he left with [[Lisana\|Lisana]], though refrained from using it as he didn’t understand it until he trained in the [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Sky Pillar\|Sky Pillar]].

Corinne dances around Averill, taking advantage of his blindness, though his [[blindsight\|blindsight]] gives him the upper hand when she attempts to jump towards him. Fen also attempts to trip her. Regardless, she attempts to go for a hug and pet him. <span class="spoiler">Girl leave him alone 😂.</span>

Fen redirects our attention to the elves who may or may not be waking. Averill immediately agrees, and accepts Ashissa’s arm. Corinne takes this opportunity to grab his other arm.

>**Fen:** [...] stop touching Averill, it’s difficult!
>**Corinne:** Technically he’s got armor on, so it’s not like I’m physically touching him.
>**Ashissa:** (quickly) Are we ever really? Really our atoms are just this close, and we’re never actually touching anybody. 😂
>**Fen:** Oh my god, Ashissa, seriously?
>**Ashissa:** Is this not the time? My insight is really low, so I don’t read social cues. 🤣🤣🤣
>**Fen:** (with emphasis) Did you read Averill’s face?
>Averill makes a strained noise.
>**Ashissa:** What am I reading? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
>**Fen:** His angry polite face. I feel like, if [Corinne] was not a girl, I think that he would have already punched her. It’s all I’m saying.
>**Averill:** (defensive) Past me —! ... (deescalates) No even then, I was actually quite a gentleman. I’m always a gentleman.

Fen defends her previous point, then clarifies with an example. Averill agrees recalling his bullying days with exuberant nostalgia. While he appreciates Corinne’s help, recalling their conversation from earlier, he questions her intentions. She proceeds to put her head on his shoulder, giggling. He attempts to pull out of her grasp.

Ashissa checks on Myron, who appears to be okay for the moment. He expresses how worried he was about her. Fen overhears them, and calls Ashissa out for nearly turning on the team for some abs. 🤣 The yuan-ti apologizes in response, unsure of what happened. Averill then out of politeness attempts to give Ashissa to her boyfriend, while asking Fen to guide him. The girls try to dissuade Corinne, even suggesting that Twin needs help, but to no avail. 

Ashissa whispers to Averill, suggesting he steal from Corinne, noticing the elf’s continued disdain for Twin. The solider argues he’s a lawman, implying he wouldn’t dream of it. “It’s the attempt,” she advices.

As we step out of the space, we each feel one last pulse of the void energy internally. We feel as though this encounter has tethered us to the essence of the [[Empty One\|Empty One]], as we are now in direct conflict with him over the destiny of [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Adrilos\|Adrilos]].

>[!spoilers] Destiny Points
>A new mechanic is introduced. 🥳👀👀
>
>Once per check, if we decide before we roll, not knowing whether or not the roll succeeded or failed, that it needs a boost, we can spend a Destiny Point and add a d4 to the roll. Spending a Destiny Point allows the “enemy” access to more Destiny Points, allowing the DM to add a d4 to their roll as necessary.

We emerge from the massive double doors and most of the elves are still unconscious. A few dozen stir, a handful right themselves, though still appear dazed. We discuss messaging [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Sovarin Juran\|Sovarin]] via [[Sending\|Sending]] to know where she is and who presently in Aden Vala could immediately lead the people. Moradin suggests casting [[Speak with Dead\|Speak with Dead]] to possibly convince the late Sovereign to give us information. A majority of us disagree, wanting nothing more to do with Volu.

Averill offers to do crowd control, recalling his time in the Chasmian City Guard, specifically in the Noon District. Ashissa informs Sovarin both Luthais and Elnaril are dead. Sovarin tells us to look for [[Vera Liora\|Vera Liora]], a dark-skinned elf with green eyes and golden hair — Corinne vaguely knows her. Our able-bodied members help Corinne search for Vera.

Corrine eventually finds her just as Vera rights herself, though she appears dazed. She addresses Corinne who then briefly fills her in on the situation. Fen elaborates mentioning Graz’zt, though Vera asks her to slow down. Once being led to her with the help of Ashissa, Averill reverses the drug-like effects with Lay on Hands. 

>**Averill:** (politely) May I have your hand?
>**Ashissa:** (sardonically) So it’s okay when she does it? 😒
>Averill proceeds to pump his remaining 5 points to neutralize the poison.
>**Lexie:** Whoa! Dinner and a movie before you pump stuff into people. 🤣
>**Chris:** Jeez ...
>**Majesty:** I don’t know what you’re thinking about but [...]
>**Jacob the DM:** We are recording aren’t we?
>**Majesty:** Yes! 😅
>**Lexie:** That’ll be there. 😏

The effects lessen, though Vera’s headache persists, prompting the solider to apologize. Fen returns to the previous conversation, going into necessary detail of Luthais scheming and demise. She specifically states Sovarin pointed to her to lead the elves, and mentions the “dangers” of the fungus above. The elven woman then notices she’s scantily dressed — she fit though 👀. Vera admits she has medicinal training and knows the correct processes to rehabilitate her people. She doesn’t feel fit to lead, however would be willing to until Sovarin returns. 

We suggest she contact Sovarin through magical means, though not through us as we’re on a time crunch to “save the world.” Moradin begins spouting nonsense about an edible arrangement, though Fen and Averill persuade Vera to ignore him. Fen apologizes for everything and for leaving them to deal with the chaotic aftermath. She takes our word, though Moradin offers to show her the head until we immediately dissuade him. We apologize.

Fen steps away to begin drawing a teleportation circle. Corinne encourages Vera, and reaffirms Sovarin’s words. Moradin offers a prayer to ease tension, but covers her eyes as he creates a message in the ground via [[fabricate\|fabricate]] that says “You can do it.” He prays to the gods, calling them to assist and to bless Vera with the wisdom to lead, etc. Clouds form at top of the large cavernous space and a bolt of lightning strikes through Moradin, channeling into the floor. Every single elf then begins to stir — the gods heard him. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

<div class="neon-wrapper"><div class="neon center">You Can Dew It</div></div>

Thunder rolls continuously through the cavern. Averill pats Moradin, “Good job.”

Fen finishes her [[teleportation circle\|teleportation circle]], rushing us to enter. Corrine takes a moment somewhat hesitant, but we call for her to follow — as if she had the choice. 🙄 We arrive in [[Felindra\|Felindra]], near the rotting [[Verdant Hall\|Verdant Hall]]. Poor Ashissa complains about forgetting her [[immovable rod\|immovable rod]] and Fen about the [[portable hole\|portable hole]]. 😂 

We catch up with [[Sovarin\|Sovarin]], Corinne draws a play-by-play of all that happened — she receives a compliment from her mentor. Fen calls Moradin out, stating it wasn’t a real prayer recognizing he was bsing. Averill genuinely asks what constitutes as a “real prayer,” tabling the question for another day.

Sovarin thanks Moradin, understanding his particular brand of good-do-dery, and offers to paint him a portrait or any other piece of art — it’s the least she can do. He asks if he can include another person, though Averill nearly threatens him if he was implying Fen. Ashissa suggests he should get a family portrait. As this goes on, Corinne wars Sovarin to never use [[detect thoughts\|detect thoughts]] coupled with [[Encode Thoughts\|Encode Thoughts]] on the dwarven cleric. 🥲 

>Wait, so because of what we’ve done, *he* gets a portrait of himself?
>
>— Ashissa

Sovarin extends her deepest gratitude to the rest of the group. Averill admits her words are more than enough, though suggests to the others if they truly wanted something to go ahead and put it out there. When she gets the chance, she hopes to pay us back for our kindness. Corinne sketches of Ashissa as *the* badassest bitch in the world, over-exaggerating her efforts during the fight and the journey whilst *saving* her friends and the elves. 😎

Fen suggests Sovarin to contact her parents ([[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Adran Elandris\|Adran]] and [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Valna Elandris\|Valna Elandris]]), regardless things will be very different for the elves. Sovarin asks what they did when they settled down, and Fen replies they opened a book store in [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Wisderne\|Wisderne]], settling there because of [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Gaelira\|Gaelira’s]] presence in the valley. According to Sovarin, Fen’s mother was the court wizard in [[Aden Vala\|Aden Vala]], however she never revealed this information to her daughter. 🫢 Her parents never talked much about Aden Vala — there was a lot of pain in leaving. While they never spoke negatively about it, they chose not to speak about it at all.

Fen admits that ever since leaving Wisderne, she knows little about her own people and culture. She doesn’t believe they’ll return to Aden Vala, uprooting their life in the valley, however they may visit now that things have changed. <span class="spoiler">What if they new something fishy was going on? 🤔</span> Fen voices that maybe one day she can come back and learn more about her heritage. Sovarin merits them from keeping the toxicity away from the “young” wizard. Based of her newfound experience, Fen agrees. Sovarin points out she missed a lot of the beauty, though Fen argues she would have never met [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Illian\|Illian]].

>I’m not remotely suggesting that your life should have taken a different path, just simply be aware that nothing comes for free, and everything you give up that you believe is entirely good, you are also giving up something else that may have advantaged you.
>
>Sovarin to Fen

[[Sovarin\|Sovarin]] expresses she feels more like herself and will travel soon. She asks about our next plans. Moradin wants to go see his [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Ailleen Thraudmere\|mom]], though Fen notes that we need to get to [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Belda Sil\|Belda Sil]] asap. Ashissa is hesitant at first and suggests meeting and possibly gathering the yuan-ti refugees for reinforcements (distraction/rebellion). We need to gather intel on the status of the island, etc. She then warns us that we need to get through a ziggurat to enter the tower.

>[!info] God Tower of Belda Sil
>The tower sits on an island in the middle of a lake with a single bridge, which connects to the ziggurat temple.

Fen notes that getting inside the temple will be no easy feat — it’s never easy. 😒 Though, with our new abilities and other magical items, maybe it won’t be too difficult. 🤞🏽

>[!addon] Our “To-Do” List
>We have quite the journey on our hands, but here’s a few things that need immediate attention:
> - Go to [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Belda Sil\|Belda Sil]] to return the god gems ([[Laf’Loran’s Geode\|Laf’Loran’s Geode]] and [[Path in Purgatory/Items/Carilla’s Onyx\|Carilla’s Onyx]])
> - Return to Dham Auram and confront [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Cardinal Divitae\|Cardinal Divitae]]
> - Return to Dualis to deal with the conflict between [[Chasima\|Chasima]] and [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Spenwald\|Spenwald]]
> - Go to [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Gorin\|Gorin]] to save [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Benson Thraudmere\|Benson Thraudmere]] and confront the minotuar, who is currently amassing forces

We begin to explain a few things to Corinne in regards to the Cardinals and the God Towers. Fen expresses her discontent, feeling personally targeted by the [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Void Walkers\|Void Walkers]], which prompts Moradin to attempt to relate to her and give her a hip bump. <span class="tink glitch"><span>Tink</span>Tink<span>Tink</span></span> <span class="tink glitch"><span>Tink</span>Tink<span>Tink</span></span> <span class="tink glitch"><span>Tink</span>Tink<span>Tink</span></span>. Fen attempts to copy Corinne and dance away, though she looks real awkward, but receives approval from Corinne. Averill gets between them, and threatens the cleric with a couple of newly required smites. 💥💥💥

Walking away, Fen and Ashissa argue about the boat, especially in regards to casting. The sorcerer argues she could easily cast the spell faster, and in a huff of frustration Fen gives it to her to figure out . She understands it’s designed specifically with Fen’s magic in mind but understands a few of the intricacies put in place. The wizard feels a little smug, seeing her friend gain a deeper understanding of the spell.

Averill apologizes to Sovarin about the circumstances, expressing his sympathies, she in turn apologizes for the journey/path we’re on, knowing it may get worse. The conversation prompts Averill to tell Corinne about what happened in [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Dham Auram\|Dham Auram]]. 😞

Averill wishes Sovarin the best of luck, turns and remembers he needs help, to which Myron assists. “You know buddy, we don’t talk a lot. We should talk more.” <span class="glitch"><span>¡Viva la BROTP!</span>¡Viva la BROTP!<span>¡Viva la BROTP!</span></span> 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

Corinne stays behind to talk with Sovarin. Now that there is no longer an elven city to be protected, the young elf is considered to be on leave.  Sovarin promises to keep her in the loop, and no matter what happens, she has a place there. Corinne expresses her appreciation towards her mentor, making it hard for her to leave, however she feels this is the direction she needs to go.

>**Sovarin:** Over the course of centuries, it is rare that you encounter someone who can genuinely surprise you ...
>**Lexie:** And I’ve met so *freaking* many in one group ...
>**Majesty:** All in one day! 😂

Sovarin tells Corinne that if she traveled with our group, she would find herself amidst link minded company. Despite the difficulties, tension, and everything that has transpired, she believes this will be good for her and for our group. Corinne inquires about Sovarin’s art styles, wondering if she can learn without her. The elder elf reassures her that she believes in her talent, noting her keen eyes.

>You’re good with your hands too.
>
>— Moradin, not to far from the conversation 🤦🏽‍♀️🚩😅😂

Corinne glares at the dwarf before averting her attention back to Sovarin. She thanks her mentor for trusting her with one of her masterpieces to learn a new skill. They give one another a tearful hug.

<span class="spoiler">Expecting Averill to pull him by the ear, Moradin is left to himself. One has to note that Averill has officially <em>retired</em> as Moradin’s babysitter, and has been quite unfriendly towards the dwarf for the majority of the day, quite angry and disappointed from last night’s events.</span>

As they pull away, Moradin calls out to Sovarin, telling her that if she ever needs us to message [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Cadogan\|Cadogan]]. (He’s not a contact Sovarin would mention to a lot of people. We know Sovarin because of Cadogan.)

>**Jacob the DM:** Biscuit Patricia is getting *real* lonely and she makes some really good biscuits. 🤣
>**Chris:** They’re making biscuits together.
>**Crystal:** She just holds the pan out for him and (*proceeds to blow on imaginary biscuits seductively*) warms them up. 🤣 And then they share the biscuits.
>**Lexie:** Insta-biscuits, right there! She said, “I also have ✨*jelly*✨”
>Chris is disgusted. 🤣🤣🤣
>**Zerai:** No ma’am!
>**Lexie:** (continues) Can I ✨*butter*✨ your biscuit, Patricia?

Once boarding the Guilded WInd, Ashissa contacts her [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Zeska Pythan\|mother]], wondering where she is so that she may visit. A minute passes and her voice comes in a whisper. She is currently scouting on the island, but the other yuan-ti are along the coast between where the mountains meet the ocean. Fen suggests we head towards the larger group, and when necessary, convene with Ashissa’s mother on the island. 

We assume from where we’re at it’ll take about three days to get to our next location. It’ll five us a few days of rest, and time to test out the capabilities of the boat. Moradin asks why we would need to quicken our trip — we want to test out what would happen should we return the god gems to their designated towers.

Ashissa contacts [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Zossa Pythan\|Zossa]], who’s at the hideout, learning that some more friends have arrived. He looks forward to seeing her soon, ending the message on a funny note. “Do do do do do do ... Are you pooping?”

We tell Corinne *everything* that’s going on — the towers, the god gems, the [[Empty One\|Empty One]], the Void Walker’s plan. The gods originally put their consciousness into the god gems after the [[Path in Purgatory/Lore/Blight Year\|Blight Year]], and now we have to place the gems to the towers so that the [[Ten Ascendent\|Ten Ascendent]] may return and reverse whatever the Void Walkers are planning. Corinne expresses that she doesn’t wish to become a vessel, though we assure her that is not the case. 

We argue about Luthais’ true intent — Averill believes the Sovereign truly believed he was saving his people, while Fen and Moradin argue otherwise. Moradin mentions the head, offering to cast [[Speak with Dead\|Speak with Dead]], though Averill is adamant, Fen is indifferent, and Corinne wonders if we could learn more about the past from him. It would be difficult considering previous conversations — the dead also don’t have to tell us anything and can lie just as easily. 

Fen elaborates that it would be a waste of time, considering the Cardinals don’t really want to tell us much — Luthais was actually the first to be “open” ... and we totally crapped over his “hospitality.” Moradin suggests disguising as Duke Elnaril to ask Luthais about the whereabouts of each of the Cardinals, and Myron agrees, believing we may learn something from the encounter. “Now obviously we should take whatever information we get with a grain of salt, but it’s not a bad idea.”

Fen then reminds us that the whole point of our journey was that we grew tired of chasing them around, especially whenever it felt like they were always several steps ahead despite our interference. Rather than chase the Cardinals, except in a few particular instances, we want to focus our energy on gathering the god gems and placing them in the towers. Regardless, they seem to have a knack for finding us ... the option would serve best whenever we hit a dead end.

Averill mentions going to sleep to recover his sight, but upon hearing the time (a bit past noon) rethinks his decision before his his friends demand he rest. Corinne offers to lead him, grabbing his arm though he gets out of her grasp as Moradin offers and asks him to trust him. He begrudgingly takes the offer. Moradin mentions they can talk later about what happened, though Averill argues he already said his piece — there’s not much more to talk about. He thanks the dwarf, and enters his room.

Fen goes down to rest, remembers the lack of functionality her door possesses, and rooms with Averill to complete her trance. She notices him clutching the [[sending stone\|sending stone]] before crashing for the remainder of daylight.



Twin is already out, preparing for a well needed catnap. Myron and Ashissa take the helm and we set sail. Moradin informs everyone via [[message\|message]] that dinner will be ready in the evening. He works on another project, hoping to talk with Fen later. 😅🗡🗡🗡 (<span class="party glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span> on a project 🥳) He gets to experimenting with cooking.

Corinne joins Ashissa and Myron at the helm, dancing around them. After her trance, Fen goes up on deck and begins reading; she does offer to take the helm so that either Myron or Ashissa can rest.

>[!summary] Spark Notes
>Corrine asks about the [[Path in Purgatory/Lore/Blight Year\|Blight Year]], which we were led to believe was a calamitous event triggered by the gods’ disappearance. The god gems, though kept secret, were being discovered and having the consciousness of the gods. Everyone in our group has encountered a member of circumstance caused by the Void Walkers who have been collecting the gems to accelerate what they believe to be the inevitable end of the world for the sake of creating a new one. 
>
>In a meeting with dragons, who were servants of the gods when they still walked the earth, we have been instructed to locate the god gems and return them to the towers. The dragons believe and hope it will bring the gods back to the Material Plane, and prevent the inevitable destruction and fix all of the problems going on.
>
>Our group may have the correct assortment — there are five towers and ten god gems representing the [[Ten Ascendent\|Ten Ascendent]]. We believe Laf’Loran and Carilla are associated with the tower on [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Belda Sil\|Belda Sil]], Ashissa’s island.
>
>Both [[Laf’Loran’s Geode\|Laf’Loran’s Geode]] and [[Path in Purgatory/Items/Carilla’s Onyx\|Carilla’s Onyx]] were tainted by [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Graz’zt (PP)\|Graz’zt]] and [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Orcus (PP)\|Orcus]] respectively. Gaelira’s Emerald remained pure, however, it remained unreachable until the Nameless Ones acquired it. <span class="spoiler">Somehow [[Tres Leches\|Tres Leches]] are mentioned regarding Orcus and Lindhaven 👀👀👀.</span>

Ashissa tells Corinne she received Carilla’s Onyx from [[Lord Winry Selek\|Lord Winry Selek]], who was supposed to give it to the heir, her son, who was a Void Walker. Fen describes the little weasel, painting him in a very bad light. He was an underdog, and often road the coattails of others. He attempted to prove a point that eventually led to his demise. Ashissa apprehended him, and based on rules, the gem now belonged to her. Myron confirms her story. “She handed it over to me with a sad face, because her son was dead.”

Rather than forced to take it, Ashissa accepted the gem feeling that it had a close connection to her goddess and a bunch of other stuff (Orcus). Corinne asks her to elaborate, and a handful of the group can attest to wearing the wretched thing. Fen inspected it, though it scared the bejeezus out of her. *Skip.* 😅 

Corinne asks if Ashissa has been possessed yet, however, Carilla has protected her every step of the way. She continues, inquiring if the demon prince has talked to and/or manipulated the yuan-ti at some point. Apparently, she felt his presence before encountering [[Bishop Revnon\|Bishop Revnon]]. Corinne asks if she have safety measures in place — code word “pineapple” — though it could be argued he can hear everything. Fen describes Ashissa’s unique brand of chaos, which is hard to copy much less recreate; we would definitely know if something was up.

Ashissa jokes that me may be possessed, prompting Corinne to sus her out. She’s obviously possessed by her love of hot men. 🤣 <span class="spoiler">Cue questionable hand gestures and movements that may or may not be painful.</span>

Corinne points out a few things about our journey, mainly Fen going unconscious, though that has a lot to do with her being a wizard. She currently holds the record for dying the most — a fact that upsets Ashissa a bit, as that made her special. She argues killing innocent old people is now her niche, though Fen clarifies that was out of self defense.

As they continue to talk, Ashissa takes Corinne’s used sketchbook and begins to paint the old lady incident. Corinne freaks out, despite the raw talent Ashissa displays. Fen tells her it’ll be okay and to allow the sorcerer to finish her story. Corinne snaps and demands Fen’s sketchbook, and the two argue.

>**Fen:** That’s. Fucking. *Different*.
>**Corinne:** No. It. *Isn’t.*
>**Fen:** Really, can you still do magic without your sketchbook? Cause I *can’t* without my spellbook.
>**Corinne:** You can make *new* spellbooks, just like *I* can create new art. It‘s not the same, they’re memories.
>**Ashissa:** I feel like my story is getting lost. 😂

Ashissa continues on her spread while the bard and wizard continue their tiff, inquiring details from Moradin while describing the event to Myron, who cringes. Corinne hyperventilates as Fen praises Ashissa’s skills. Ashissa totally signed the painting before it was done. Corinne holds an empty sketchbook, horrified at the display, and Fen hands her crappy paper to make up for it. “You can probably sew that in right?”

Corinne quickly makes a fake spell on the crappy paper and hands it back to Fen out of spite. Ashissa attempts to get the girls back on track, and Myron quickly leaves to make tea, feeling uncomfortable by the whole exchange. They summarize the event, comparing it to our brief encounter with the Lonelies in the Ashwood and the disfigured form of her father in the Shadowfell, which explains the violent assault. Ashissa warns Corinne to never groan lest she get blasted. <span class="glitch"><span>PTSD</span>PTSD<span>PTSD</span></span>

Laf’Loran proceeds to goad Corinne. “That would be *very* entertaining.” 😂

They mention Zossa’s knee jerk reaction when she scared him a few weeks ago in Felindra, nearly killing his sister. Corinne gifts Ashissa a smaller, yet blank, sketchbook; telling her that art is like therapy, so is dance. She offers a few suggestions, eventually showing Ashissa how to crump, and offering a few other angry, aggressive dance moves. Though she doesn’t really give off those vibes, though Corinne meant releasing passionate energy from her body.

>You can be aggressive, but I don’t think you’re angry.
>
>— Moradin’s accurate depiction of Ashissa.

Ashissa tends to release that energy through [[Eldritch Blast\|Eldritch Blast]], while Fen prefers to incinerate, which prompts Corinne to want to [[encode thoughts\|encode thoughts]] for Ashissa to incinerate. Ashissa quickly nopes out of that. 👀👀👀 Fen warns her not to visualize the moment she incinerated a body as Ashissa told her it was scary. Corinne then recalls the outlined body in the captain’s quarters and attempts to psychoanalyze Fen. In full sane logic, she would do it again; she has a list. 💯

>**Corinne:** It’s just that eventually those are things you would like to get done?
>**Fen:** Eventually those are things I *will* get done. 👏🏽

The afternoon passes and evening comes. Averill seeks respite by approaching his friends after having a [[Path in Purgatory/The Party/Averill Warin Kane#^nightmares\|nightmare]], triggered from the events of the day. Corinne hands him a sketchbook and he begins to draw the bloody cryptic scene(s) — somewhat similar to the mass of piled bodies under Aden Vala, but surrounded by a sea of blood. Corinne and Ashissa associate it with his guilt, however, he’s had these nightmares long before the battle. Corinne inquires if it points to the future or his past.

He begins to flesh out more details as the bodies pull and drown him as his body gives way. He explains it began before the Gorin Incursion, as though it was a warning. However, it kept recurring over and over with different iterations and got worse. He admits he suffers from survivor’s remorse, surprised he came out alive — Fen relates this to another personal conversation she had with the solider a few weeks prior in Dham Adamas

The incursion was a blood bath; a small minority of individuals pushed things back, otherwise the Gorin forces would have accomplished whatever it was they were going for. [[Chasima\|Chasima]] is a well-trained military city-state, however, the forces that went out to meet the incursion were neither numerous nor well equipped as they should have been. Realization comes across Averill’s face as he mulls over the details. He whispers, “Sacrifice — they keep saying sacrifice.”

<span class="floaterR">
	<img alt="" height="250" src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/022/524/tumblr_o16n2kBlpX1ta3qyvo1_1280.jpg">
	<p class="caption">HOW DARE SIR, I do not appreciate you.</p>
</span>

The Gorin Incursion was a ploy of sorts; it was part of the Void Walker’s plans. Myron asks, “Why Riverna? Why not attack the city?” What was so special about [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Riverna\|Riverna]], a small, quiet, mundane town along the outskirts of Chasmia? Literally nothing 🫠 Had they attacked Chasmia the full brunt of the military force would have met them — it would have been a fair fight.

“What were they going in to fight, if they weren’t claiming anything?”

Ashissa thinks back to her time in Riverna, though recalls [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Reed Cloudcrest\|Reed’s]] death at the hands of the Void Walkers, which was a decade after the incursion. Averill notes he only had five years of training before they fought the forces, and the minotaur was an overwhelming force on his own. They asked who was in charge at the time — Colonel [[Mattias Valerin\|Mattias Valerin]] — however he didn’t make it.

>[!spoilers]
>**Jacob the DM:** You know who wasn’t at that fight. 😏
><div class="row"><div class="col-6"><img alt="" height="250" src="https://media.tenor.com/Fipe91QSAegAAAAC/dedikodu-gossip.gif"></div><div class="col-6"><img alt ="" height="250" src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/568/692/63a.gif"></div></div>

Averill realizes that the former Captain now Colonel  of the [[Dawn Striders\|Dawn Striders]], [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Garon Nero\|Garon Nero]] possibly plotted against Mattias, who he felt inferior towards, and may be in cahoots with the Void Walkers. He hated the Averill’s guts, but the young solider was a brat. Averill then gaslights himself, believing he’s thinking too far into a conspiracy. However, Garon wasn’t present during the incursion, yet he still got promoted. Averill justifies that even he should not have been promoted to captain, much less deserve it as he got it through nepotism.

Fen tries to shift his mindset, saying he was there, but Garon was not. Moradin asks who gave him the promotion. Unfortunately, Averill didn’t pay too much attention to the politics in Chasmia cause he found it *stupid* 😛 — suddenly feeling stupid he didn’t pay *more* attention. The girls point out that the Void Walkers choose individuals in high positions, especially those who think highly of themselves and would do anything to promote themselves further. Ashissa then concludes that Garon Nero set the incursion in motion to kill Mattias.

They continue to suggest that has he gained more power, the more he owed the Void Walkers, using his power to pull strings to further their agenda. Averill argues that regardless, he wouldn’t have much power and influence to send the entire army to [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Spenwald\|Spenwald]], as Chasima is influenced by the [[Blazing Chapel\|Blazing Chapel]] and [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Lord Onias Felgrand\|Lord Onias Felgrand]] — who is related to the [[Cloudcrest’s\|Cloudcrest’s]]. ... The priest below the high priest ordered Averil a few weeks ago to report to report to the front line ... may not be captain no more 😬.

>Just say you died. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
>
>— Ashissa, our resident liar 😂

Corinne asks us to elaborate as she knows nothing about Spenwald being under siege. It’s possible the information is purposely being kept in Dualis. 🤔 Though not too long before, we stopped a Void Walker plot.

Corinne attempts to show concern for Averill, pointing out the amount of stress he’s experiencing, but he snaps when she mentions his career, revealing he never cared, being forced to join. She steers the conversation towards home, suggesting he should go home immediately, but the idea is shot down. She warns him that his high position may have put his family in grave danger, especially with the various things she has heard from tavern to tavern regarding political plots.

Fen argues Averill is not so high up as to gain that kind of attention, recalling old books she read. 

>[!info] Chasmia
>Chasmia is different — captains refer to the individuals over the city guard within the four districts of the city. The military is divided into subsets: the city guard, the military reserve and the intelligence gathering.
>
>The Felgrand family came into power through a religious campaign in the city. Therefore, their political sway is tied to the continued power and success of the Blazing Chapel.

As Corinne talks about her experience, which prompts Fen to question her age. She ignores her until she makes her point to Averill. He doubts it as his family has plenty of connections — remember it’s two dealerships, one old money (Dubois) and the other new (Kane). The Dubois are high up nobility in Chasmia, and the Kanes are known well in Riverna. Angry with himself, he admits he only joined the military to protect Zuri and his siblings, because his maternal grandfather gave him an ultimatum as *the* heir — his parents pressured him as well, especially his mother. 

Averill suddenly asks Ashissa to contact his baby sister, Perdita, recalling she was in trouble for some time when she returned home. 😂Trying to connect the dots, he recalls some of Quintus’ studies, prompting Ashissa to ask for a list of his siblings.

>[!info] The Kane Siblings
>1. Averil Warin Kane, the eldest
>2. [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Darina Lior Kane\|Darina Lior Kane]] (Dorito), the “evil” songstress
>3. [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Matilda Enid Wickham\|Matilda Enid Wickham]], who has a five year old son named [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Theodore Wickham\|Theodore]]
>4. [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Perdita Irene Kane\|Perdita Irene Kane]]
>5. [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Quintus Alexander Kane\|Quintus Alexander Kane]], the prodigy in Hidela
>6. and finally [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Richard Mar Kane\|Richard Mar Kane]], who most of us met in Port Laska

Perdita eventually answers Ashissa. She’s okay and happens to be in [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Port Laska\|Port Laska]] with Richard. Ashissa jokes that they’re in the middle of a huge war, unfortunately, the stressed solider believes her. She quickly retracts upon seeing his face, she apologizes reiterating she can’t read people, though he adds that Zuri proclaims he can’t take a joke. He asks for no more jokes in regards to safety or lack there of. 

Apologizing for coming off as uncaring, Fen inquires why Averill felt the need to share, what triggered it — <span class="spoiler">(1) obviously it’s the guilt from attacking his friends, (2) still suffering from the Daydream room, (3) it’s been a hot minute since his last nightmare, (4) the live disturbing imagery of the underground, (5) considering the imagery was similar maybe it was all tied together — it was — (6) Vala wasn’t present, and (7)</span> Zuri’s not here — all the ingredients for a meltdown 🙌🏽. Corinne offers to sing to him, but it’s not the same. 

He mentions he already talked to Zuri, learning things are tense back at home, which makes him think back to their conversation — what’s so *dang* special about Riverna?! Fen inquires again and he admits he’s only sharing, not lookin for them to solve it, and somewhat took her jabs from earlier personally ( 😂 <span class="glitch"><span>Emotional Damage</span>Emotional Damage<span>Emotional Damage</span></span> ). He also mentions Ashissa’s earlier offer to unpack his dreams. They encourage him to keep sharing, and to use the journal to log his dreams etc.

>Just sometimes knowing you need to trust somebody else with your struggle, makes the struggle easier.
>
>Fen to Averill 😭

We all express how disturbing it is that everything in our lives almost revolves around the Void Walkers.

>It is almost like something is lingering over us, who is trying to control us — almost like a puppeteer. It’s disgusting ... it’s wearing a stupid hat. 🤣
>
>— Ashissa breaking into entering the metaverse

As the conversation comes to a close, Averill suggests we all eat. Averill apologizes, but she tells him to do otherwise. The girls encourage him, telling him they want him to trust them enough to come to them with these things and to invite them into his struggle. Ashissa continues, saying they wish they had more answers, though Averill was never really looking for them — he does have more questions now. Most of them can attest to weird dreams.

Moradin gives some insight after he apologizes, attempting to comfort the distraught soldier. He also expresses he’s glad the solider trusted the group with his thoughts. He understands and tells him he didn’t deserve that moment, no one does; however, we can choose to make the most of our life and live in the moment for those who didn’t get the opportunity. 😭😭😭

Corinne has been strangely quiet for some time, and her demeanor is sad and empathetic. Fen asks Corinne how long she had been studying under Sovarin; about a couple of years. She claims to be in her late 20s — between 27–29, maybe 28. Fen begins asking a few of us her age (237), and explains that elves typically don’t leave home before their first century, making Corinne a bit young to be adventuring. Fen asks where she’s from, though Corinne explains it’s trauma related — eventually she snaps and admits she was kidnapped. Upset, she storms off.

Moradin then approaches with a new set of arms, carrying a large amount of plates. He just finished them earlier sometime in the afternoon. He tested it out while cooking, some of the food isn’t exactly cut evenly, but it‘s decent. 

Averill leaves to go find Corinne, with food in hand. They have an emotional conversation, and Averill realizes they are very similar in a few aspects.

Moradin and the others have a toast.

Ashissa goes to talk to Corinne, who slides a piece of paper under the door. Ashissa draws a picture, and she is yanked into the room. She tells her she understand about hiding her true image. Corinne gets comfortable and introduces her true self to Ashissa.

Corinne asks about why she got antsy near the Verdant Hall — Carilla’s Onyx has ties to Orcus, thus it was triggered by the necrotic energy. Orcus’ energy was all over Lindhaven when the gem was present. Ashissa corrects her saying it was pain, not fear.
