</div></div>



<div class="spoiler"><p>Averill travelled with Lisana the Gold to the Sky Pillar. The location of this divine phenomenon is in the northern Falivar Desert, a sandy wasteland where he survived only by the food he were able to scrounge and water Lisana brought with her. As they approached, there appeared to be a pillar reaching into the sky of daylight that shifted in orientation based on the positioning of the sun, nearly blinding in power and filling all shadows, causing the land to seem almost punctured by its power. At night, the location was shrouded in utter darkness. Thus, what is contained within the Sky Pillar is incredibly difficult to discern.</p>

<p>Lisana explains that she brought Averill here due to his recent acceptance as a Paladin of Vala. It was sacred tradition to bring his paladins to this location as a test of will and fortitude. His time here was spent entering the light, attempting to withstand its radiant and fiery strength. Several of these sessions left him near death. He took note that at precisely noon each day, the light of the Sky Pillar seemed to lessen into a mirage of energy, and within an oasis could be seen far away with large figures glimmering and moving in the light.</p>

<p>In a few rare moments, what appeared to be large moving figures gained clarity, appearing to be metallic structures like buildings, incredibly tall and surrounding one central structure of red and blue at its center. The metallic city was surrounded by a gorgeous oasis. People seemingly adorned in the brightest armors walked the oasis and sands, barely discernible. During this time, Averil learned to better channel Vala‚Äôs divine energy, realizing its full power and utilizing his shadows to shroud and protect himself from his burning light. Upon refining his Solar Plexus ability, Lisana seems satisfied to return him to his group.</p>

<p>Averill attempted to glean information from Lisana regarding the city and types of worship Vala would appreciate.</p>

<p>All she gives about the city is that it was not built during the time before the blight year. She doesn‚Äôt seem fully sure who inhabits it but feels certain that Vala‚Äôs power in the Sky Pillar is protecting the city. She feels that one with his gem could possibly enter and discover what the city truly is but she is uncertain. There may be more to it than that.</p>
    
<p>As far as worshipping Vala, she indicates that his followers of old were far more pragmatic and ordered than they were pious. She is disgusted by the existence of the blazing chapel in Chasmia and the highly ritualized worship they enforce. She encourages you to walk a path of order and a strong code of justice. Seek vengeance when necessary but do not slay with a heart of hatred. Use anger but avoid sinful passion. It was common in the ancient way for paladins of Vala to ceremonially clean and brandish their swords at dawn as a sign of faithfulness to him. She then starts to speak on Sun Shadow. But seems to hesitate.</p>

<p>Averill persuades her to continue. She says that Vala had the weapon crafted during the War of Gehenna to be wielded by his greatest of mortal champions. He had left the golden claw-like pommel open to receive something, though none of his followers knew what. In those days, a rare sort of person called the far-born had the power to draw upon the infinite void and other possibilities and manifest these forms. These warriors were able to refract and control Vala‚Äôs light to an incredible capacity and only the greatest among them would be called the Zenith Knight who was the rightful heir of Sun Shadow.</p>

<span class="sticky">Wonder who that could be ... ? üòÖ</span>

<p>Unfortunately she doesn‚Äôt seem to be very forthcoming about personal information. She does state that she is the daughter of the ancient dragon, Lastir, who was the chosen champion of Vala and that she fought in the War of Gehenna.</p>

<em>Vala‚Äôs Amber is somwhere in Dualis, possibly with a Cardinal.</em></div>

---

Zossa goes to find Ashissa, saying he found what he needed and it is now time to part ways. He asks when she will come visit. She informs him that she will be in touch when the time comes. Before leaving, he made a few things and hands them to her, individually wrapped for each person.

She opens all the presents. For Twin, there are a deck of cards (not all 52, a [[Deck of Illusions\|Deck of Illusions]]) for his chaotic and creative nature. For Fen, a smaller item, a font style pen ([[emerald pen\|emerald pen]] that casts the [[illusory spell\|illusory spell]]) that does not require ink to write and illusion magic. Ashissa looks and calls for Fen to cast [[Identify\|Identify]], though cannot seem to find her immediately. 

For Moradin, an intricate headband ([[headband of intellect\|headband of intellect]]). Zossa enjoyed swapping ideas with him and hopes this helps with his creative pursuits.

Lastly for Ashissa, a glass bottle filled with swirling black smoke (an [[eversmoking bottle\|eversmoking bottle]]). He worries for her safety and the item should help her escape from her foes. She tries really hard to identify the items, without the spell. She learns what the items are and tests her gift.

Then they hear a familiar beating of winds. Like a speeding sun ray, a golden dragon approaches Twin and Ashissa. Averill descends from Lisana‚Äôs back, and she wishes him good luck before leaving. He attempts to catch up with the two present figures of the group. Twin attempts to play mind games treating Averill as either a stranger or Myron‚ÄîAverill is used to it at this point.

They relay that they fought a dragon, a giant catfish (to which Twin now has a squid), and Bishop Revnan (deceased). Averill, first, corrects Ashissa, informing her that Zuri *is not* pregnant‚Äîshe doesn‚Äôt believe him. He then tells them he trained in the [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Sky Pillar\|Sky Pillar]], relaying it as a near death experience, and earned a severe tan (as if he wasn‚Äôt dark enough already). 

(As Averill was flying, to the south, he noticed three massive trees around the Emerald Evertide, Aden Vala.)

We get concerned that Fen and Moradin are taking too much time picking flowers. We then hear another wing beat coming from the south. We see a relatively small figure with rainbow colored wings wearing a jester‚Äôs outfit in yellow and green. She remains airborne. She tells us that Sovereign Luthais greets us and she is Inara, the court Jester.

Apparently, we‚Äôre intruding in his domain and he has requested an audience with us. She hands Averill a purple stone (possibly a sending stone). We discuss our next steps, seeing as they captured Fen and Moradin, and begin traveling toward Aden Vala.

The mist begins to obstruct our vision (iridescent) and then it dissipates. It is perpetual twilight, dome in the sky (possibly similar Spenwald). We see a city built into the trees (3 massive tress), each having a purplish sheen/swirling pattern, calculated chaos in structure. In the air, we smell various fruits, foods, wine. We hear the sound of music and revelry. People are enjoying themselves. Beautiful colored plants, insects, as through we were thrown into a highly saturated oil painting.

Lots of forms of art being created, but much more extreme than Frenevid. Everyone is in varying degrees of dress, some are nude. Ashissa approaches a woman and another elf, both who are drinking and being leisurely in various states of undress, to ask where to find the sovereign. The woman points to the tallest of the three tress (Arbora Regala), and offers Ashissa some of her wine.

Twin takes the wine that Ashissa rejected. His caution is now all gone (oh boy).

A random elf named Darran offers us several vials of (Grafita Dew). It has fun affects in how we perceive things. Grafita Dew is a hallucinogenic substance from a plant that grows specifically in Aden Vala. Twin steals his stash with ease, but the elf doesn‚Äôt mind once he realizes he‚Äôs lost everything on his person.

Ashissa casts sending to contact Zuri as Averill hopes to find her in the city. Zuri doesn‚Äôt know where she is. According to Ashissa, she sounded dazed, distraught and confused üö©. Twin uses his ability to get the general direction of Zuri, and it points to the tallest tree. She may have been captured with Fen and Moradin. (Luthais signed his death warrant üó°Ô∏èüó°Ô∏èüó°Ô∏è)

We stick out like sore thumbs as everyone around us is an Elf, no other humanoids are here. Everyone appears to be enjoying the ‚ÄúMidsummer Night‚Äù festival levels of revelry going on. 

A hooded feminine figure grabs Ashissa telling her to follow her if we want to live. We follow, no questions asked. She takes us up a set of rotating stairs, and find ourselves inside a surprisingly nice treehouse. We meet a light skinned, albino female elf, named Sovarin. She informs us that the festivities outside are normal to a degree, however, they are usually not as intense nor coerced. 

As she goes to make tea, we notice the house is filled with paintings, well crafted and in various art styles/movements (impressionism, realism, abstract, etc.). Twin inspects the paintings and notes the initials SJ, which mirrors the paintings we saw in Frenevid and while with Cadogan. This painter also did the painting of the [[Path in Purgatory/Lore/War of Gehenna\|War of Gehenna]]. (Cardinal Volu is obsessed with art.)

Averill uses Divine Sense as a precaution. There is a tinge of fiendish presence in the air. 

Sovarin prepares tea, but Twin decides to distribute and purposely drugs hers (pretty sure we all saw). 

She admits she knows Cadogan and that he has mentioned us to her. Ashissa uses detect thoughts on her, not fully trusting her, but Sovarin indeed knows Cadogan. They go way back‚Äîthere‚Äôs a fondness and longing/missing as she mentions him.

Twin points out the paintings and the initials. Her name is Sovarin Juran, she‚Äôs around 1,200 years old.

Aden Vala, over the last few centuries, has affected the elves that lives there. Any elf who lives in the space loses a sense of themselves. They are easily driven to do anything they are told.

The strange purple shapes on the trees is a supernatural fungus that has been festering. The more it has grown, the more the affects have grown. In the last several months, any elf that has entered quickly begins to loses any sense of their former selves. (This doesn‚Äôt bode well for neither Fen nor Zuri.) Sovarin wears an amulet to hold the affects at bay, which was given to her by the sovereign himself.

She is a part of the court (official artist) and happened to be present during the founding of the city along with the Arawaik, Elandris, Ilvaris, and Kairi families. Sovereign Luthais brought everyone together during the [[Path in Purgatory/Lore/Blight Year\|Blight Year]].

Sovarin has grown suspicious of Luthais the last century as he has made questionable decisions, especially as of late. She‚Äôs concerned he may be in contact with questionable people. Averill shows her the symbol of the Void Walkers. As of late, the sovereign has it in his writing üö©. 

When the city was first founded, Luthais preferred Lof‚ÄôLoran over Gaelira.

Volu (a term of endearment), a slip of the tongue from Sovarin ... üö©üö©üö©

The sovereign mentioned changes that would be coming and wanted to prepare a festival for his people. *It may be soon.* A few things have been slipping through the cracks and that he may be in cahoots with concerning entities ‚Ä¶ (definitely the Void Walkers)

In the meantime, she has been preparing and gathering information. She suggests not going to dinner and meeting him when he is away from everyone. Averill looks into the possibility of the dinner, seeing instances of the possible future. There is obvious tension. Some instances show that we walk away with our friends; others show them dead, or Luthais ends up dead. Sometimes we loose our temper, or we stay calm, cool, and collected, but walk away frustrated.

This event is not 100% a death trap, however, given the circumstances and his track record, Averill understands his temper may prove fatal, and Ashissa offers [[Calm Emotions\|Calm Emotions]] if necessary.

Sovarin informs us that at midnight, on the dot, Luthaius is away from everyone. It is a sacred time for him. None of his servants are around. She emphasizes (again) he is her dear friend. She just wants to make sure he‚Äôs not doing something life-threatening (oh, you poor lady).

To pass the time, Ashissa wants to shop around. Sorvarin warns us that this is a bad idea, but will not contain us. Ashissa mind links with Averill in order to teach him her charismatic ways since he‚Äôll be doing most of the talking (proficient in Elvish) as they head out into the city.

We step into the wand shop (Garas and Verrel‚Äôs Wandwright) manned by an older elf with a widow‚Äôs peak wearing a flamboyant coat. He‚Äôs drinking wine and introduces himself as Garran. He shows us a [[Wand of Fireballs\|Wand of Fireballs]] (1,500 gp), a [[Wand of Entangle\|Wand of Entangle]] (300 gp), and a [[Wand of Polymorph\|Wand of Polymorph]] (5,000 gp).

Garran notices that Ashissa and Twin are quiet, and they *unfortunately* speak in other languages (gibberish, Thieves Cant, and Undercommon). Averill is stressed after the encounter. üòÇ

Twin notices there‚Äôs no sign of Thieve‚Äôs cant nor the possibility of an underbelly in the city.

We go to the alchemist (Ciare‚Äôs Tinktures), who is wearing a flowing dress and flipping through a book. Ciare is a bit suspicious of us as we ask about a solution to stay sober in this not-so-sober city. She shows a clear liquid with a greenish hue (water filtered from the Emerald Evertide, [[Purified Evertide Water\|Purified Evertide Water]] 50g). She happens to have four [[30 Resources/Equipment/Potion of Healing\|30 Resources/Equipment/Potion of Healing]] (75 gp), two [[Potion of Healing (Greater)\|Potion of Healing (Greater)]] (200 gp), and one [[Potion of Healing (Superior)\|Potion of Healing (Superior)]] (500 gp)

She shows a clear, spinning liquid ([[bottled breath\|bottled breath]]), the effects are similar to a super powered burp (300 gp, 1 use). She takes out a bulbous bottle, [[potion of aqueous form\|potion of aqueous form]] (400g, 1 use). She shows an age reversal potion (physical only, [[potion of longevity\|potion of longevity]]) that happens to be popular amongst the half elves, and a vial of clear, gelatinous oil with tiny silver shards ([[Oil of Sharpness\|Oil of Sharpness]], 1 use), any weapon to a +3 weapon (1200g). *Sounds nice in theory, however it only lasts for an hour.* 

We buy the Purified Evertide Water, healing and greater healing potions. (Twin and Ashissa have one greater and one regular, and Averill has the water and one regular.) Upon leaving, Averill noticed she flicked her hand, possibly casting a spell of sorts. üö©

We head back to Servarin‚Äôs house. Averill was stressed about the shopping trip to which Ashissa assumes he has social anxiety. *Being in Aden Vala under the circumstances and the atmosphere gives the ick.* He admits he knows how to socialize, very well at that, being part of the Kanes (paternal family) and Dubois (maternal family)‚Äîhis parent‚Äôs were socialites‚Äîhowever, he preferred to use his fists. He‚Äôs just more concerned about his friends being in danger. Ashissa calls him out on his hero complex and to allow the group to save him once in a while, to which she first pointed out the group knows very little about Averill‚Äôs upbringing/background. 

He reveals a little more about himself and his social standing. Yes, he is the heir to some ‚Äúdealership(s),‚Äù like Moradin, but in the grand scheme of things it matters very little to him‚Äîfor reasons he does not entirely share. Twin has heard of the Dubois (high military standing) as they have made a few contracts over the years and happen to have quite the reputation in Chasmia. Ashissa also recounts her time in Riverna and heard of a family closely related to the Dubois and had connections to the lord (Cloudcrest).

Inara sends a message when it is time for the meeting. Twin suggests Averill drink wine to take off the edge, but Averill, speaking from experience, admits drinking causes more problems than alleviate. He accept Ashissa‚Äôs offer to cast Calm Emotions should the event rise that he cannot control his anger.

We arrive at the base of the tree, and find her there, noticing that she is the only fairy (fey) amongst elves. It‚Äôs a long way up from the base of the tree, and poor Ashissa ends up tired from the ordeal.

The building is somewhat of an optical illusion, contrasting with the wood of tree. No guards are posted and we see a number of elves walking around and partaking in the revelry.

We follow Inara to the foyer of the palace, of what can fit into the tree, and see a small orchestra playing and cirque du soleil dancers moving gracefully. It‚Äôs oddly beautiful despite the context. Their motions appear too measured despite the fluidity, and they appear too in sync. It‚Äôs somewhat off putting. We enter the dinning chamber, finding a long table carved out of the tree, similar to the furniture we observed in Felindra (except literally a part the tree carved to form furniture). 

At the end of the table we see a figure, similar to Ashissa‚Äôs skin tone, with very long graying brown hair. He appears youthful and wears a regal robe of darkened but vivid purple and green colorations. At the far end is an immaculate throne-like chair, nice place to sit. Around him are various well dressed elves sipping on wine. He waves his hand and the elves disperse the dining space moving in sync, somewhat robotic. (Someone may have some control issues ... üö©)

He welcomes us and gestures us to take a seat. He snaps his fingers, and an array of food and wine comes out before us, again everyone moving quickly and in sync. He asks if we would like to eat or converse first, to which Averill voices openly preferring conversation given the circumstances.

Sovereign Luthais admits he is Cardinal Volu. If the conversation goes well he will return our friends. He then asks why we‚Äôre in the Elven Wood. Present party members attempt to dodge his questions (honestly the entire conversation, if possible), giving somewhat truthful answers. Unfortunately, we have to be candid with him.

Ashissa calls him out on his poor attempts at ‚Äúsmall talk‚Äù as it‚Äôs obvious why we‚Äôre here (other than to save our friends). She notes that we‚Äôre looking for gems, etc. He asks how many we have, but Ashissa deflects to conversing about kids. We do end up talking about the gems, admitting we now have two, and he happens to have Laf‚ÄôLoran‚Äôs Geode.

He tells us he means no ill will, though we‚Äôre not buying it, especially since he had to *resort* to kidnapping to have an audience with us despite the fact we eventually would have come to him. üôÑ Our interactions with the other cardinals and bishops influenced his actions, though we admit none of them exactly treated us in an agreeable manner.

However, we directly (and continually) oppose them, becoming a thorn in their side. Rather than explain their plans, they expect us to turn a blind eye to their actions‚Äîwe obviously don‚Äôt considering they aren‚Äôt doing things that are considered *good*.

He sees that we‚Äôre in a world that is doomed and is doing everything he can to save his people. He asks if we noticed that the world has been falling apart, to which we admit the only time the world was falling apart was when the Void Walkers were involved. There are members who believe that accelerating the destruction is beneficial. He mentions the disappearance of the Boon Current, earthquakes in the dwarven mountains ‚Ä¶ the world is possibly ending. They have different goals and ways of going about it (*a house divided*).

He‚Äôs been protecting his people by keeping them drugged, mollified and in one place to avoid the upcoming catastrophe. He notes we had a conversation with Bishop Degaros, who happened to be his mole to learn about Divitae‚Äôs plans. (Twin takes off the hat ü§£)

The Void Walkers know quite a bit about us, as a party and individually, as they have a network of information they share with one another. Averill carefully asks how much do they know about them to which Luthais reminds Averill of his status in society. Luthais calls him young Master Kane, which irks him, telling Luthais to refrain from doing so. 

<span class="sticky" style="width: 350px">Corruption may be high in Chasmia in tandem to Void Walker influence, specifically in regards to Priest Xovem contacting Averill back in Port Laska. The Void Walkers are using various, if not personal, means to get rid of the Nameless Ones.</span>

Gresado, being loose-lipped mentioned the Empty One to us ([[Path in Purgatory/Session Notes/Session 008 - 04092021\|Session 008 - 04092021]]). Luthais is under the impression we have information, and asks who we are working with. Ashissa proudly proclaims ‚ÄúThe Gods,‚Äù to which Averill (skeptic paladin) and Twin (Catlord) back her up.

He asks what sort of picture have the gods pained for us, to which they haven‚Äôt, and they unfortunately mention Sovarin. (Luthais slowly realizes he is talking to the wrong party members, however Fen was disposed and Moradin was well ... Moradin.) Ashissa asks why would we admit anything, when in reality, we know very little (from both sides). We‚Äôre doing everything on a whim as the gods haven‚Äôt necessarily painted a picture. We admit that our actions are purely based on morals and that we see their actions as evil‚Äîgoing with the flow.

Luthais assumes we are gifted people who are misguided. We‚Äôre doing what we believe will protect to people, especially from evil fiendish entities. He poses the question, ‚ÄúWhat if the way you‚Äôre protecting the people isn‚Äôt the way they need to be protected?‚Äù We pose the question back to him in regards to his people.

The land Adrilos was grander than what it is today, and a part of something greater than just itself. However, it was stolen by the deities we‚Äôre connected to, from the one that was emptied by that which was his. Ashissa makes a dig at the Empty One, and Luthais admits she is making the conversation unpleasant. Averill stops her from becoming too heated (apparently, she needed calm emotions instead üòÇ), and then asks why would the gods take Adrilos from the Empty One. ‚ÄúBecause they were power hungry and wanted the land for their own ...‚Äù

Averill, being an asshole while dancing around Luthais convictions, tries to play devil‚Äôs advocate by presenting that maybe all the gods, including the Empty One, are power hungry. The conversation leads to the origins of the Empty One and why we never heard of him. Over time under the rule of the ascendant deities, knowledge of him was hidden away. 

The Void Walkers have gleaned knowledge from those who existed before the gods laid claim to the land (demons and/or devils) to restore the Empty One. He has promised a world that is not doomed to fall apart due to the ignorant choices of gods who do not understand the land and the power it holds.

He is resentful of the gods‚Äô methods of communication (fragments), manner, demeanor, etc. He argues they are the reason the world is failing, and becomes frustrated when Averill continues to mention the cycle of life and death. ‚ÄúWhy does it have to be so? And why can I not save all of my people from the impending doom?‚Äù He is prioritizing the people who he knows he can save, and offers us to join them in the amassing to save ourselves when we assume his plan only favors the elves.

However, in regards to the mass genocide, Twin questions how this helps the Void Walkers achieve their goals. Luthais argues he‚Äôs not in agreement with that particular part of the plan. *Why are they even working together, if they do not wholly agree?*

Their goal is to yield the power of the world to those who can hold it and return it to the power to whom it belongs rather than the ascendant deities. Twin deduces they‚Äôre killing the worshipers of the gods to return everything to the Empty One. 

Averill asks how is he so sure that the Empty One is truthful. Luthais has felt the extent of his never-ending hunger to receive what was taken from him. üö© Taking that into context, we argue that he may want more than he‚Äôs presenting‚Äîhe may be the power hungry one.

Luthais asks if we were around when the gods walked the material plane. He argues that they feigned a sense of dignity and compassion for the people, and that by creating a world that was doomed to fall apart, they were either careless or willfully ignorant. He is resentful of the gods‚Äô methods of communication (fragments), manner, demeanor, etc. He argues they are the reason the world is failing, and becomes frustrated when Averill continues to mention the cycle of life and death.

‚ÄúThis world has to end for that to begin.‚Äù

Twin then jumps to Luthais‚Äô proposal, and what he is now expecting with us. In three days time, a rend will open for his people to escape the material plane and enter another (possibly the Feywild). We could either join or remain and it will take place in the dinning room (possibly), or rather in the palace. 

Given our history with gates, Twin asks whether or not something will come from the other side (demons/devils). Luthais says this will go differently (in theory), and that he will not be joining them, to which Twin and Ashissa note he is ‚Äúgetting rid of the followers.‚Äù He irately reminds us of his love for his people.

Ashissa asks why he‚Äôs giving us the offer to join his people, as we are not elvish. We have proven been a thorn in the Void Walker‚Äôs side for some time, especially for a few key members. It would be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù with us out of the picture.

Twin asks how many people we can bring, to which given the circumstances, only the people present in Aden Vala. Though, the invitation is extended to friends and family who can make it in three days time. Twin and Ashissa berate him for not having teleportation circles at the ready. 

Averill then asks him when did he first notice the ‚Äúsign of the times.‚Äù The world was doomed the Blight Year took place‚Äîthe last surge of power escaped the land and opened up space for the Primordial Planes to come crashing in. They began to stabilize, but only for a short time as it was a cataclysmic beginning of a decline that would inevitably pass.

He then compares our age, as he has lived for over millennia and managed to survive such events, flexing that he understands more than us. Neither Twin nor Ashissa are impressed. üôÑ But they begin to push his buttons. 

<span class="sticky">Averill begins to appreciate the lessons he gleaned from his mother. *Wise as a serpent, but harmless like a dove.*</span>

The conversation then shifts to our party, as we have a lot to ‚Äúdiscuss‚Äù‚Äîmajority rule and a possible life commitment. The topic of mortality comes up as life is meant to be lived, but eventually you have to move on.

Twin and Ashissa ask when the true world-ending events will begin. To which Luthais counters it depends on our actions in regards to the Void Walkers‚Äô plans, hinting we are prolonging the process. 

He seems to not appreciate our simplicity, to which we argue ‚Äúwe have little time.‚Äù Averill admits that if he were to crossover, he wouldn‚Äôt live long regardless. Luthais poses the question, ‚ÄúWhy not enjoy every single moment that you can and not cut it short.‚Äù Averill admits that how he would enjoy it is different, even if short.

We ask for our friends again, though Luthais admits they will be disposed for a time. With a wave of his hand, his attendants bring Fen, Moradin and Zuri, all unconscious. Averill leaves the table to check on them, ignoring the food. There‚Äôs no evidence of blunt trauma, however they each have a pained expression on their face.

Before we conclude, Twin asks whether or not we should converse again or meet in three days time. Luthais hints at the sending stone. 

Moradin, thankfully still has the emerald.

Ashissa attempts to ask Luthais to hand over the geode, considering his contempt for the gods, to which he refuses (again) as it houses the powers of the demon he is connected with. A measure of their influence has allowed him to tap into power of the gem. Though he had means of communing with Graz‚Äôzt before coming into possession of the gem.

She then asks which of the devils and demons have the others sided with. 
1. He‚Äôs connected to Graz‚Äôzt (demon, lust); <span class="spoiler">vs Laf‚ÄôLoran</span>
2. Divitae to Mammon (devil, greed); <span class="spoiler">vs Winora</span>
3. Immortuos to Orcus (demon); <span class="spoiler">vs Carilla</span>
4. Arcanis (wears a mask) to Mephistopheles (devil, pact); 
5. Fero to Baphomet (demon) <span class="spoiler">the minotaur is related to him</span>; 
6. Desparo is a unique case (maybe Asmodeous?).
He gives us this information to curry favor.

(There are six (6) cardinals in total, and each presumably to have a bishop below them. Had there been seven (7) cardinals, they could have represented the seven deadly sins, unless Luthais conveniently left out one cardinal. üôÑ *Previous notes do not support my claim.*) 

<span class="sticky">The number six (6) in biblical numerology represents the flesh of man, human weakness, and the manifestation of sin. It is one number short of being ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù</span>

Averill asks if all the Cardinals answer to one‚Äîis there one higher in the hierarchy? They all have varying degrees of power despite being on the same level (equal standing) in the hierarchy. 

Ashissa asks who all are in agreement with one another, with Averill mentioning everyone in the party are all reasonable, taking advantage of him wanting to curry favor with us, but we need a better argument than potential genocide. Arcanis sides with him, allow the events to happen organically, as he does not wish to see unwanted destruction. However, is open to other possibilities if the methods work, not necessarily agreeing with Divitae‚Äôs methods which are a means to accelerate the process. No one knows exactly what Immortuos is doing nor what she wants. (No one likes Divitae. üòÇ)

Luthais then asks what do we want, to which we all want to live (on our own terms). Ashissa takes another dig/jab at Luthais, who takes it in stride, as life can be more interesting after a millennia.

Averill concludes the conversation, as they now need to discuss their next steps and tend to their unconscious friends. Luthais highly encourages us to take him up on his offer. 

Twin asks about the plane in which he is sending his people and for more details. He doesn‚Äôt share the details unfortunately, despite us arguing the more information we have could influence our decision making in his favor. No matter what choice we make, the world we love will come to an end. 

Averill again attempts to leave, wanting to get his friends away from ‚ÄúCoo-Coo for Coco Puffs‚Äù Luthais. We have a brief discussion about who carries who. Moradin would have originally been carried by Averill, had Ashissa not mentioned she would have dragged her out. (Unfortunately, Moradin would wake with a huge headache. üòÖ We discuss whether or not to put him in the bag of holding, though 10 minutes in the portable whole would have been preferable.)

Just before we leave, Ashissa asks for a means to transport our unconscious friends. Luthais mentions we could take the lift down as if knew about it. Inara played us. Ashissa threatens to chop off her wings, however, Luthais admits she is highly precious to him. Taking that into consideration, Twin asks about the experiments in Felindra, which happened to be an unfortunate sacrifice to save many more lives. (Luthais may sacrifice her to open a gate to the Feywild.)

Averill uses another divine sense. The celestial glow from the gem around Ashissa‚Äôs neck is almost blinding, though there‚Äôs traces of a fiendish presence‚Äîsame applies to the geode, but not the emerald (celestial only). The general sense of fiendish presence is more intense here in the palace. Luthasis is obviously walking into a trap (of his own making). ü§´

We head towards the lift, despite the others wanting to explore the palace, to leave and head back to Sovarin‚Äôs house. Twin clocks that Luthais ascends up the steps away from the atrium where the other elves continue in their revelry.
