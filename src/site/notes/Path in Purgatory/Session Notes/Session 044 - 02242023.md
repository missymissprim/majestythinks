>The Nameless Ones acquire Laf’Loran’s Geode and converse with the deity in question, who establishes a connection with Corinne. Before we exit Aden Vala, we locate Vera Liora, informing her of the recent events and leave her in charge under Sovarin’s suggestion. Once back in Felindra, we set sail and discuss our next steps. In the evening, Averill wakes from a nightmare and shares with the group, which leads to several conspiracies and revelations. We  learn that things seem off about Corinne, though Ashissa is the one to confront her.

>[!warning]
>This session is mostly out of character shenanigans. Y’all are hilarious and I cannot even. 😂 So it’s time to play of game of *The Things Players Say!*
>
>**Disclaimer:** You may skip these as they’re not too plot relevant, but they sure are hella funny ... especially the audio.

>[!addon]- The Things Players Say
>As we give a recap of the previous session [...]
>**Zerai:** And, Moradin’s cool little tinkering of his arms. Do you guys remember that?
>**Random Collective:** Oh yeah! Yeah!
>[...]
>**Jacob the DM:** So, Moradin has created a magical item that essentially has Doc Oc arms.
>**Crystal:** That’s right! [...] Cause that’s what Moradin needs is *more* hands!
>**Lexie:** Double the grope. 😏 [...] “Now I can grope two people.”
>**Crystal:** “Imma bring *two* people back to life! Don’t mind me.” [...] He’s like, “Ashissa come assist!”
>**Chris:** I’m just trying to increase surface area, you know!
>**Jacob:** Ugh, that’s so groupie(?).
>**Majesty:** No thank you, YIKE™, how dare.
>**Crystal:** Who had “Non-Con” on their 2023 bingo? (*pause for suspense*) Moradin! 😂

Ashissa, Corinne, Moradin, and Myron all go to sleep while Averill mans the helm headed toward where the mountains split along the coast. Fen comes up on the deck to hang. Twin follows and takes over as he’s technically our captain. He begins pressing buttons to make the ship “go,” pretending he knows what he’s doing (wasted <span class="wasted glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span> 😭). <span class="spoiler">It’s not a Bop It.</span>

Fen doesn’t know what he’s doing, and Averill looks on confused standing at ease. She asks if we should speed up the boat. 👀 She comes up to the helm and speaks the command word, “Brisara.” The runic sequences light up, glowing bright crimson. Everyone feels the boat lurch forward as an intense orange red flame streams out from the back of the boat — a few of them may have fallen off their beds. 

We see a series of concentric, magic circles rotating around each other which the flames are anchored to in order to propel the boat. Fen notices they ungulate a bit, to non-magically perceptive eyes they appear perfectly steady, however, she sees that the glow gets closer and closer together slightly, estimating it will last about 7–8 hours. She discerns that if she speaks the command word again, the propulsion will turn off. It typically recharges *at* dawn.

<span class="spoiler">Considering the magical propulsion, Twin gets the impression that Gresado must have been in <a class="internal-link" href="Dham Auram">Dham Auram</a> for a while, possibly sometime between when we left <a class="internal-link" href="Port Laska">Port Laska</a> and when we arrived at the dwarven city. It definitely increased his speed significantly. Apparently, the tabaxi turned Gresado’s ash pile to a litter box. 😂</span>

Averill asks why they didn’t figure this out when they first acquired the boat. Though it was a rhetorical question, Fen gets defensive and explains she was developing her spell to fold it.  She continues stating we’re not the smartest group, to which the soldier admits *he’s* not (would never speak for the group 😅). <span class="spoiler">Rather than smarts, maybe it’s just priorities. Honestly, we haven’t had a chance to relax and look around. We had/have a bunch of stuff going on.</span>

Averill then apologizes to both Fen and Twin, feeling guilty for attacking them despite the Graz’zt’s charm. Fen lets him know that wasn’t on him — it *wasn’t* him.

>[!addon]- The Things Players Say
>**Fen:** It’s not like you were attacking us because you *were* attacking us. You were attacking us because you were magicked to attack us. [...]
>**Lexie:** Plot twist, that’s what Averill wanted to do this whole time.
>**Jacob:** He is the big bad.
>**Lexie:** It’s the darkness coming in.
>**Crystal:** (acceptance) Averill is the big bad.
>**Chris:** I thought I was the big bad?!
>**Jacob:** Majesty, let’s talk about this after the game.
>**Majesty:** Okay cool, just add that to my list.
>**Chris:** I was wrong.
>**Zerai:** We’re working on it.
>**Lexie:** A work in progress. [...] You have to lose the entire dealership.
>**Chris:** It’s not really about the adventure, but  it’s all the big bads we make along the way.
>**Jacob:** Plot twist, I’m setting you all up to be big bads and go against each other in the end.
>**Lexie:** At this point, we don’t even know if we’re actually saving the world!
>**Crystal:** I mean we already talked about how Fen could easily go that route.
>**Majesty:** And [Averill] would be her bishop! [He] pledged his sword to her.
>**Zerai:** And Corinne is definitely afraid that her body is going to be a tempest.
>**Lexie:** Y’all are nightmares.
>**Majesty:** We’re the nightmare team right now.
>**Aaron:** You have Theta and Adari, we’re just rebuilding it.
>**Jacob:** Feels right.
>**Aaron:** (to Chris) You’re Theta again! Just brought him back in.
>**Crystal:** You’re not wrong!

>Moradin is *faith* Theta.
>
>— Jacob

A thought occurs to Averill, which he decides to entertain walking down to the deck away from judgmental eyes. He pretends to train, however he whispers to [[Path in Purgatory/Items/Sun Shadow\|Sun Shadow]] in draconic. “You’re not sentient are you?” 

“Why are you whispering?” the sword asks, though Averill nearly yeets it but mentally reboots instead. Confused, the soldier inquires more, and [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Vala\|Vala]] reminds he was nearby. The sun god doesn’t have as much liberty to speak to his paladin as he would like. Totally relived the sword’s not sentient, Averill continues with his request. He expresses he would like to train/spar with the god in order to build a deeper connection with him as he had done with his friends. 

“We battle together every time you take this weapon into combat. Or did you mean something else?” Definitely something else 😬. Averill hopes to visit him in his dreams as he knew the god was present there last (few) time(s). He attempted to ask Laf’Loran, but that went *oh* so well. If Averill were to build a connection with someone who could get on the trickster’s “good” side, perhaps it could happen. 🫠🫠🫠

“Could be fun though.” Thanks Vala 😭. As the soldier process that suggestion, he asks about the [[far born\|far born]] and the [[Zenith Knight\|Zenith Knight]]. Unfortunately, time is limited but they can talk almost everyday.

>[!addon]- The Things Players Say 😅😂🤣
>Sometime between the interaction above.
>
>**Majesty:** (out of character) I’m going to try to talk to [[Path in Purgatory/Items/Sun Shadow\|Sun Shadow]].
>**Crystal:** (in character, judgtngly) Your sword?
>**Jacob:** Okay!
>**Majesty:** I’m going to get away from “judging” people over here (Fen and Twin) while I go — he just goes down, and you don’t know what he’s doing.
>**Chris:** Oh I see. So you won’t talk to your friend, but you’ll talk to your sword. Got it alright. 😒
>**Jacob:** Sorry, I gotta go talk to my sword for a minute.
>*Collective sounds of disgust and laughter.*
>**Chris:** Is that what we’re calling it these days?! Wow, dude.
>**Crystal:** No, we know if Moradin’s talking to anything it’s a dagger. 😅😂
>*Follow a pained Chris and collective “Awwws”*
>**Lexie:** I think, uh, Susie — is that what’s her name?
>**Jacob:** Su.
>**Lexie:** I feel like her full name was Susie.
>*Laughter.*
>**Jacob:** Canon. [...] Her name is Su-Sie.
>And somehow the conversation transforms into dwelves, hwarfs, and hwelves ... we know how we got there.
>**Jacob:** Biscuit Patricia was all about the hwelves! 😂

Averill sighs heavily on deck, prompting Fen to ask if he’s okay. He has to talk with Corinne, but is obviously dreading it. Fen expresses she owes the bard an apology, feeling bad for accusing her of lying. She tries to be friendly, but Corrine pushes the wizard’s buttons, encouraging Fen to want to trip her — or you know [[shocking grasp\|shocking grasp]]. Intrigued, Averill asks why Corinne irks her. 

>**Fen:** I’m a friendly person, normally! 
>**Averill:** (trying not to laugh, shakily) Yeah ...
>**Fen:** And I’m *not* scary.
>**Averill:** (jokingly sarcastic) And I’m not a bully. 😬
>**Fen:** *Normally.* Normally not scary.
>**Chris:** Can I insight check *ALL* of *this*?
>**Crystal:** No you’re asleep, go away!
>**Lexie:** You don’t have to insight check that.
>**Chris:** You’re hearing from [Averill’s] sheath: WEE WOO! 🚨
>**Jacob:** Twin, make a Con save for biting your tongue right now. 😂
>**Fen:** Twin am I — I’m not — Twin doesn’t think I’m scary! *At all.*
>**Lexie:** Oh don’t bring *him* into this. 😅
>**Chris:** You hear from [his] sheath: BULLSHIT.
>**Crystal:** (as Fen) Vala doesn’t think I’m scary.
>**Averill:** (carefully choosing his words) I mean, scary is relative. I don’t particularly — I recognize you *are* dangerous.
><span class="floaterR"><img alt="Side Eye" height="200" src="https://media.tenor.com/HQP8daGP4dsAAAAd/side-eye.gif"></span> **Fen:** That’s *different*!
>**Averill:** Yes.
>**Fen:** We’re *all* dangerous.
>**Averill:** Yes.
>**Jacob:** Averill is side-eyeing Twin. 😂

Fen admits she has a few triggers — a button even! Everyone has one, some react more physically violent than others. <span class="spoiler">Please to refer to <a class="internal-link" href="Session 023 - 01072022">Session 23</a> and <a class="internal-link" href="Session 041 - 01132023">Session 41</a> for more information about player violence.</span> 

>[!addon]- The Things Players Say
>**Chris:** Who’s the least dangerous person in this group?
>**Crystal:** Moradin.
>**Aaron:** Ah, maybe physically? But, uh, psychically. 👀💀
>**Jacob:** Theta was also the least dangerous in Star Wars.
>**Chris:** Y’all send people to the hospital, I send them to therapy. 😅💀
>**Aaron:** You may not be able to murder people, but you can drive people to —
>**Crystal:** — to murder, yes! 💀
>**Chris:** I run people to murder themselves.
>**Crystal:** That’s murder.
>**Chris:** I don’t kill you, I just make you wanna.
>**Lexie:** What a gift. 😂
>**Jacob:** [Moradin’s] dad actually ran away. 😂
>**Lexie:**  He’s like, “It wasn’t you! ... It was Biscuit Patricia.”
>**Zerai:** Oh wow!
>**Chris:** (offended) How could you runaway from Biscuit Patrica?
>**Lexie:** She had a dragon thing.
>**Jacob:** Their marriage was on the rocks, you know.
>*Excited realization noises amongst giggles, laughter and other nonsense.*
>**Crystal:** Sounds like Moradin’s dad also spends time talking to a dagger. 💀 Maybe Biscuit Patricia was looking—
>**Lexie:** —looking for a sword. A *greatsword.*

Upon mentioning what we now dub as the “Weasel,” Fen wants to speak with Moradin. He was skeezy in the beginning, however was much cooler then. She believes a conversation is necessary, having ignored the issue as much as she possibly can. Averill agrees she needs to set boundaries. Twin quietly offers that talking would be better than a letter, direct confrontation over subtle letters. 👀👀👀 She attempts to justify Moradin’s behavior assuming the dwarf believes he’s trying to be helpful; Averill calls her out on it, like no ma’am. 

Twin tells her to have a conversation with him, and to tell him even if Elliot was dead, the dwarf has no chance with her. He suggests she make out with someone else in front of him. Not counting Averill who’s engaged, her only option is Twin. Averill argues Ashissa is a safe alternative. 😂 She wants to address it in the galley while a few of us subtly mediate/supervise the interaction. Averill recalls doing something similar for his sister (Matilda) when she was courting her husband.

She goes down her lists of upcoming conversations, and Twin voices Corinne is capricious without knowing she is. Fen needs to apologize regardless, finding it strange an elf would be out adventuring so young. Averill argues he and Zuri, a half-elf, left home young — while it’s different for other races, it might be different for each elven family as well. Fen states she wants to talk to Moradin before Averill, but the solider has nothing to say to him. She offers that if she talks to the dwarf first, he might be distracted enough to not want to talk to the soldier.

Fen even proposes to talk to Corinne first since it’s short, “Speaking as the only other person on this ship who has unwanted affections coming at them.” Averill doesn’t believe Corinne is being serious just as Fen doesn’t believe Moradin is serious. If Corinne gets to be too much for the solider, Fen will turn her into a weasel 👹, though Averill says he’ll deal with it, promising [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Zuri Malika Bonnet\|Zuri]] will “cut” her if he hasn’t figured it out by then.

>[!addon]- Players are the worst, it be your own friends 😒
>**Fen:** I feel like Zuri would kick her ass.
>**Averill:** Yeah she kicked mine. (nostalgically) She kicked mine. It was great.
>**Fen:** I don’t need to know what you and Zuri do —
>Averill looks at Fen confused like ”what did I say?” 🤨😕
>*Collective gasps as everyone misinterprets his words AGAIN.*
><span class="floaterR"><img alt="" height="200"  src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/TJawtKM6OCKkvwCIqX/giphy.gif?cid=6c09b952dzbj6ficshmywjcnt6k1za9968bcdgdepmheb3xn&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g"></span>**Lexie:** OOOH~! We know how *you* like it!
>**Jacob:** We just learned something about *that* relationship.
>**Lexie:** ✨ Oooh, you little masochist! ✨
>**Chris:** “I didn’t *know* that about myself!”
><span class="spoiler">You guys suck. 😅</span>

Mentioning Zuri, Fen offers to lend an ear whenever Averill wants to talk about what marriage is like. However in realizing she was referring to *other things* earlier, he quickly declines until she clarifies marriage in general, and expectations — nothing about the bedroom (thank goodness 😅).

>You know I’m not saying everything was perfect.
>
>— Fen on her relationship with [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Elliot Mithalvarin\|Elliot]] as Averill struggles to find words.

Averill quickly shifts the conversation to his parents, who have a healthy relationship, not the best parents though. He appreciates her offer, accepts it, and admits he’s been sleeping on marrying Zuri for about a decade, wanting to marry her much earlier. He’s the problem, and [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Chasmia\|Chasmia]] is a difficult environment. 💯

Noticing Twin’s still with us, we try get the tabaxi to open up and ask if he’s married. He nearly runs away  to go “check something” as the two chatterboxes go down a list of personal questions. “He didn’t say he couldn’t make out with me, just that it would be too much. So, I think he’s probably single.” She infers he’s not attached to anyone.



Twin returns to man the helm. Averill asks him to throw them a bone, just one, curious about the tabaxi who has yet to relay any information about himself since they all met. Fen specifically asks him where he was born. He starts off saying he was born in the woods by a garden.

>[!addon]- The Things Players Say
>**Lexie:** Twin Gardens ...
>**Chris:** Isn’t that a restaurant?
>**Lexie:** That’s Olive Garden. [...] And Twin Peaks — two very different places.
>**Aaron:** That’s how I came up with the name! I thought about my two favorite restaurants. 😂
>**Lexie:** It’s like an Italian restaurant, but girls are wearing scantily clad clothes. *But* don’t worry, unlimited soup and salad. 😉
>*We’re dying.*
>**Lexie:** Soup, salad and legs~.
>**Jacob and Crystal:** Welcome to the Gardens. The Twin Gardens. 👨🏼‍🍳
>**Crystal:** We have unlimited breadsticks.

We try not to press him as he’s been respectful and/or indifferent towards our privacy. He continues, mentioning a small village. He grew curious and started to wander. He jokes that he and his brothers and sisters were bagged and thrown into a river — they only do that to puppies. 😥

>What in the Moses?!
>
>— Lexie, contributing to Twin’s full name (Twin Moses Garden)

After a couple rough days and an intense encounter, Corinne finds herself being rocked to sleep despite the foreign atmosphere. She almost drifts into unconsciousness until she feels the ship lurch forward, jarring her from a semblance of sleep. Recalling the runes, she deduces the propulsion was activated. 

She has some vivid dreams. She thinks of home, more than she has in a long time — homesickness. Her dreams take her back to games she played as a kid, some casual with her siblings and others more pointed with her father. She finds herself aware in the dreamspace. Her dreams then move into different directions, and shift into several places she visited and connections she’s made. 

The structure of the dream seems to change. She finds herself in an impressionist style oil painting. The space seems distorted, weird and disorienting, affecting her depth perception as everything appears three dimensional except the shadows. She finds herself high up in the sky standing at the edge of a massive, yet flattened, piece of earth or stone. A river winds through the lush green plains below — the shading adjusts as to portray the moving current.

She sees[[ Laf’Loran\| Laf’Loran]], juxtaposted to the style, looking as normal as he can. He lays lazily as he does, and looks off into the distance. She turns around and sees an obsidian palace. Words hover in the air, she looks closer and she notices that its letters, the initials SJ, the mark of [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Sovarin Juran\|Sovarin Juran]]. She realizes she is inside one of her mentor’s paintings.

Laf’Loran mentions its one of his favorite places, before the Rapture — the rending of the Ten Ascendants forms from the world. The dream shifts, its no longer an impressionist painting, but more photo-realistic. Corinne finds herself in an obsidian black throne room, though its disorienting to understand depth due to the vanta black nature of the stone. It reminds her of the walls and some of the construction of the [[Veiled Palace\|Veiled Palace]] in [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Spenwald\|Spenwald]]. 

Sitting atop the throne, she sees a gorgeous woman with pale white skin, heterochromatic eyes, one silver and one black, wearing a flowing silver garb with an extended train. Standing before her is a handsome young man with blond hair and blue eyes, who kneels before the throne.

Corinne has seen this image before, it’s popped up in her dreams before, but not in this artistic rendition. She sees the kneeled figure holding out an amulet, one of the crescent moon forged from platinum, with an emerald at the top and an amethyst at the bottom. It radiates divine energy. Laf’Loran admits it’s a marvelous piece of work. He commissioned it and imbued it with his own divine power. 

The jeweler claimed it for himself, gave it to Ursa as a token of his own love. Though Laf’loran was impressed by the trick, he cursed the jeweler and his bloodline. The trickster admits he may have gone overboard. He finds it ironic that the jeweler’s descendant is currently part of a group intending to aid the gods, referring to our won blond blue-eyed cleric wearing said amulet. Laf’Loran tells her to pass a message: he’ll release Myron’s curse when the whole ordeal is complete; as a measure of goodwill his first dream will occur when the trickster’s anchor stone returns to the [[Tower of Fate\|Tower of Fate]]. <span class="spoiler">Refer to <a class="internal-link" href="Session 006 - 01292021">Session 6</a>, <a class="internal-link" href="Session 010 - 05072021">Session 10</a>, and <a class="internal-link" href="Session 039 - 12092022">Session 39</a> for information about <a class="internal-link" href="Valyron">Valyron</a>, the cursed jeweler.</span>

He wants to do one more thing while he has her in the dreamspace. He believes she would have creative uses with his particular skills. He taps her forehead releasing a puff of green and purple. He tells her how he helped link the rest of the group to our respective deities who wanted to give us their own blessings. He saved a fun one for her — hopefully it helps the group accomplish their goals.

<span class="floaterL">

	<p class="caption"> ... OH NO ...</p>
</span>

She asks what she can do with her new ability ([[Dream\|Dream]]), and the trickster has her test it out. She chooses to go into Moradin’s dreams. 😱🚨😱🚨😱🚨😱🚨😱🚨😱🚨His dreams take him to his younger days. He recalls a time he spent with his mom, half paying attention as she performs alchemy, mixing several substances. It‘s a pleasant dream where he finds a brief respite of peace. Suddenly the dream starts to shift. Fen comes into his dream. She approaches him, caresses his cheek and tilts his chin up. She leans in close looking deeply into his eyes, nearly a breath away, and says, “Don’t give up on me.” She winks, and the dream dissipates. Though dream loops for the rest of his long rest, becoming one of the most intense dreams he’s ever had. <span class="tink glitch"><span>Tink. Clonk.</span>Tink. Clonk.<span>Tink. Clonk.</span></span>

>**Crystal:** (concerned) Is he still a *toddler* in this dream moment?!
>**Jacob:** Have you changed him to his adult form?
>**Chris:** (quickly and eager) Please?
>**Zerai:** Yes.
>**Lexie:** Or she’s going to check that off *her* bingo card.
>**Crystal:** Pee-do is not on my bingo card!
>**Chris:** (so sure) It is now. According to *this* dream it is.

As Corinne moves back into her own dream, Laf’Loran whispers, ”I knew I made the right choice.”

Morning comes, and the rest of the group wakes, just as the propulsion dies down. There’s an obvious spring in Moradin’s step. Fen knocks on Corinne’s door. The bard sighs and answers the door to be greeted with an apology. The wizard describes her experience and logic, apologizing for not considering the bard’s potential traumatic experience. Corinne also apologizes for her behavior.

Fen expresses she’s not great with change. It’ll take time for her to trust Corinne, just as it did for Twin, Averill and Moradin. She rambles about her first meeting with Ashissa and Myron, having apparently missed out on buying a cool magic ring.

>Well, I say that from this morning forward, anything that’s happened in the past — like, no regrets — that we just forgive *all* past deeds. Just so that we’re on the same page.
>
>— Corinne, acting like she didn’t just compromise Fen 😂

Fen then thanks the bard for coming to check on her wellbeing during the “Weasel.” She explains she’ll have a chat with Moradin to explain that even if Elliot was dead, she wouldn’t get over him and go for the dwarf. Corinne follows with, “I definitely do not consent to rape.” 🤣

Fen asks if she’s ever been to [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Hidela\|Hidela]]. Corinne hasn’t personally been, but she has heard of it. The wizard then describes her type — Lord Kasper Divanter, who she drooled over back in [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Frenevid\|Frenevid]], and Cadogan are excellent examples. She loves hot, smart men. Moradin ain’t it.

>[!info] Hidela
>A city of Dualis that is famed for being at the forefront of arcane and magical development. It is an ally with the other city-states if one or more were to go to war with another country. 

Fen airs out Moradin’s dirty laundry, claiming he’s charming to some people, just not her. She reiterates her original purpose for the conversation, and Corinne expresses she’s glad they’re moving on. Hopefully they will either get closer or become even closer friends. 🤞🏽 

As this conversation happens, Moradin cooks eggs and catfish, eventually calling us down for breakfast. It’s quite the presentation as he cuts up our omelets.

>[!addon]- The Things Players Say 🍑
>**Ashissa:** I told you stay out of my fridge, Moradin!
>**Zerai:** Does he really get *your* eggs?
>**Lexie:** (describing where the eggs come from) He bought me a fridge for them.
>**Chris:** I made her a mini-fridge.
>**Lexie:** Made everyone else *cool* weapons and stuff, made *me* a freaking fridge.
>**Majesty:** Made me nothing ...
>**Chris:** That’s only because you — I have offered 17 time!
>**Jacob:** He literally took the time to roll Arcana checks to make a mini-fridge just so Ashissa to could lay her eggs in.
>**Lexie:** I do not put my eggs in there.
>**Zerai:** Do you just throw them overboard?
>**Lexie:** Yeah, all the time.
>**Crystal:** Well not that often.
>**Lexie:** It’s like a period.
>**Chris:** Sometimes she just sitting on the rail with her butt kind of out there. and just &ast; *insert plot plop* &ast; 
>**Crystal:** That’s why she’s dressed so scantily.
>**Lexie:** It doesn’t come out of my butt ...
>**Jacob:** That’s why Ashissa likes to up at the helm when nobody’s looking. She can just scoop — swoop back and just—
>**Lexie:** SCWOOP back
>*Lots of giggles*
>**Majesty:** But Myron’s always up with her ...
>**Lexie:** No he doesn’t get to witness that. We’re not that comfortable.
>**Jacob and Crystal:** They’re not there yet.
>**Lexie:** I do wear pants! It’s less discrete.
>**Jacob:** On that note ...!
>**Chris:** Maybe she’s got like a butt flap like those pjs, you know and just —?
>**Aaron:** An egg flap?
>**Chris:** It’s an egg flap!
>**Jacob:** (dying) It’s not the same!
>**Lexie:** (proud) Egg flap. Now that’s something you can make me. Screw the fridge I need an egg flap.

Averill asks Corinne if they can talk later, he wants to talk about god stuff. She asks if he sees her as a goddess, receiving a few exasperated noes. She winks at him. 

Moradin passes out plates, though one of his mechanical hands brushes against Fen’s. 🤦🏽‍♀️ Fen tells Moradin she wants to chat after breakfast. He lets out a high pitched yes.

>*I’ve been waiting a long time to hear those words.*
>
>—Moradin’s inner thoughts, hoping Fen is finally returning his unwanted affection

Twin attempts to talk with Ashissa, seeing everyone else pair up and schedule conversations. “Should we — no we’re good.” 😂

Fen leans over to Averill and asks him to convince Ashissa to stay afterwards with him to talk about anything. He quickly tells Ashissa he wants to catch up and talk about a turtle. “Mission: Don’t leave Fen alone with Moradin” is now go. Moradin suggests they go on a shopping trip, attempting to get Fen alone, but the solider doesn’t budge. <span class="spoiler">It’s the Neiman Markus, and apparently there’s a fantasy Starbucks and Dutch Bros. Apparently, Averill loves coffee based on a wasted <span class="glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span>.</span>

Before addressing Moradin, Fen messages Ashissa and tells her what’s happening. Fen speaks with Moradin, who suggests they take it to the bedroom, and is met with a hard no. She begins to lay down the law, warning him to be careful with what he says with Averill present, and tells him what’s what. She tells him directly that she’s not interested in him, and would rather jump over the boat in the event Elliot was dead. She begins to describe her type with concrete examples. Personally, she wouldn’t want to get involved with someone who she would have watch grow old and die without her. Averill winces at that.

<span class="spoiler">Elves already live over one thousand years — elven wizards can live even longer.</span>

Fen admits didn’t want to fall in love with Elliot, it happened, though she lives with the knowledge that even though he too may prolong his life, she’ll still have to bury him. Moradin expresses empathy, understanding what it’s like to lose someone early. She reminds him that Gaelira told her Elliot’s dead, just trapped in her realm. Moradin implies that the goddess may have appeased Fen. 

>You’ll have to forgive me, but what is the best way to get someone, especially a follower, to not only follow you blindly than to just tell them what they want to hear.
>
>— Moradin, kind of slandering Gaelira? 😳

Averill, Ashissa, and Corinne stay behind talking about Turtle’s Bane, though it doesn’t stop the solider from gripping his sword and expressing a few implied threats. But he tries to participate in the spell combo he and Ashissa wish to try out.

Fen states they’ll have to agree to disagree on Elliot. Moradin attempts to speak on their relationship — which she corrects as friendship, but he dismisses it.

>**Jacob:** Allies would be a better term.
>**Crystal:** I’m *trying* to be generous here.
>**Majesty:** (strangely aggressive) You‘re being *too* generous.
>**Lexie:** I want to keep you alive ... for *now*.

He’s tried many different methods to win her over, though now he realizes that they’re not meant to be. Fen agrees wholeheartedly, believing they’re making headway. Averill reads the dwarf who is being truthful whilst craftily talking out of his butt in order to appease Fen (<span class="party glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span> Insight 🥳) — he believes Fen only hears what she wants to hear. <span class="spoiler">Uh ... projection much!</span> She mentions conversing with Twin, who told her to come right out and talk to him, no letters or writing. Moradin admits letters can be confusing, though he’s glad she was more direct with her intent.

Fen expresses she hopes her confrontation is working better than outright avoidance. He says it’s working, which makes Averill sigh heavily. She hopes to never turn him into a weasel again, though he voices to not make promises on that — she reasons polymorph could come in handy for more scenarios other than threats. He agrees though makes a slip of the tongue in mentioning wanting to enter her small space. 🗡️🗡️🗡️

Fen then makes it very clear she’ll never sleep with him. Rather than agreeing, he understands their are limits to their relationship, and lines they will not cross. He apologizes for the [[revivify\|revivify]] situation a few weeks back. She tries not to judge him for his necrophilic interests, but he turns it, admitting touching her dead body inappropriately crossed many boundaries. He hopes they can move forward. She asks him to stop drugging her — the first incident was an accident, the times after are a pattern.

Moradin justifies his actions, saying everything he’s done thus far was for her benefit. She tells him she’ll believe him for now, but then demands he stop. Fen goes on to give an example of if she were to tell someone outside of the scenario, they would think he’s a horrible person. He tries to twist it, “Well that’s because they don’t know our relationship!” She tells him to consider it in the future.

>[!addon]- The Things Players Say
>**Fen:** [...] the drugging, and the touching and —
>**Moradin:** Kind of like, what would someone else do and how would they approach the situation?
>**Fen:** You know, I feel like if you would just—
>**Moradin:** I need to fi — to look outside for inspiration. I get it.
>**Fen:** You know what? Just think, “what would Averill do?” 
>*Silence as the rest of the table is dying.*
>**Fen:** (continues) If you were to treat me in the same way that Averill would treat me, then you will probably never have an issue.
>Averill agreeing in the background.
>**Lexie:** (ruining everything) “I too will pledge my sword.”
>**Crystal:** Oh shit.
>**Moradin:** I’ll plunge—I mean pledge(!) my sword to you.
>**Fen:** I feel like I walked into that one a little bit ...
>**Zerai:** Yeah, a little bit. 😂
>**Moradin:** I don’t have a sword ... it’s kind of hard.
>**Fen:** (deadpan) I know.

She continues with her examples, comparing Averill’s actions and words to Moradin’s, implying she would want him to approach her as Averill does. Moradin adds that’s why he believes he and the solider get along so well — Averill nearly chokes in disbelief. They come from different perspectives, but because of those differences they fit together like two puzzle pieces. *Insert suggestive hand gestures and a murderous soldier glaring daggers through the dwarfs soul.*

Fen admits the conversation has been awkward, but felt it was good ... she hopes. Only time will tell. Moradin hopes she can be more open with him in the future, though she makes a face. The awkwardness will fade with time, and the more they get to know each other, the more their relationship grows. He’s excited for the future.

> Six feet under. With Turtle’s Bane he’ll be SIX FEET UNDER.
> 
>—Averill attempting to contain his rage while threatening Moradin

Fen then threatens Moradin, should the “Weasel” happen again — defining mind rape in the process — she promises to to use the full weight of her considerable power to make what Averill did to him look like a tap on the wrist. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 “So ... two weasels?”

“More like one weasel, but like in two,” Averill mumbles, increasing six feet to twelve.

“Good talk,” Fen ends the conversation, turns and leaves the galley.

“Good talking to ya. Love you, babe!” Moradin calls out to her.  She doesn’t turn back, goes up to the deck and stands next to Myron quietly, looking out into nothing.

Averill and Ashissa conclude their notes on Turtle’s Bane upon the wizard’s swift exit. He then turns his attention to Corinne, though pleads for Ashissa to stay behind. Just as Corinne invades the soldier’s space, Moradin comes up behind him and leans against him as well. (So close to snapping.) Averill takes a deep breath and tells the bard he needs help talking to his god in the dreamspace. He believes they needs to develop a friendship of sorts, though a friendship it shall remain. 

Corinne mentions his vibes are hit-or-miss, and that he wouldn’t be comfortable with how they would achieve his request. Moradin attempts to join the conversation, but Ashissa warningly tells him to get out. Averill attempts to once again describe his boundaries in regards to his engagement. He straight up asks her what she wants from him. While the process is new, she explains she would need to be in contact with him while they slept, going down a list of possible methods (i.e. hold hands, eskimo kisses, etc). Hard pass.

She explains it doesn’t have to be sexual, but even platonically, Averill’s against it. He doesn’t want Zuri to question their relationship more than what she has the past decade. Ashissa offers to ask, and he quickly tells her don’t, warning the yuan-ti about how the half-elven bard feels about her. “She *loves* me.”

Corinne mentions that he could give her a special momento. Going down the list, the minotaur’s horn seems to be the most appropriate, and the one he would be willing to sacrifice at the end of the day. He mentions brainstorming other ideas, and expresses he would like to be good friends with her, admitting he’s new to the concept of friendship. 

Ashissa makes a face that he then addresses — obviously they’re friends, but he didn’t grow up with many. Considering he bullied bullies, she considers him a type of Robin Hood. He admits it was just fun ... sometimes, yes there was justice, but it was fun — and maybe almost murdering Moradin reminded him of those days. No need to analyze his potential dark side. 😛

As soon as the conversation ends, Ashissa runs up to watch the boat go fast. We all follow up onto the deck. At the helm, Fen says the command word and the boat speeds up. Averill comes up behind her and gives her a pat. She believes it could have gone worse, though Ashissa boldly states it went no where. Myron tries to be optimistic, believing it did some good.

Recalling the Gresado incident, she tells Myron about her threat to Moradin, stating she hasn’t gotten to use [[immolation\|immolation]] yet. Ashissa expresses her concern for the diamond, though Myron assures her that diamonds can withstand some heat.

>**Ashissa:** Like if he dies, we still need the diamond. Not that I would not be sad at his death. But we need *someone* to revive him.
>**Averill:** (skeptical of letting that menace walk the earth one more day) Mmmm.
>**Fen:** I’m pretty sure you need a body to revive him.
>*Averill bursts out laughing while Corinne expresses concern at the wizard’s statement.*

Corinne pulls Myron aside, and Ashissa mans the helm, claiming she missed it while getting upset that Myron is talking to another girl. Myron asks the bard if she’s okay; things are getting better, and she wants to talk to him privately. Noticing Ashissa’s reaction, Myron attempts to ask if she’s okay telepathically, but she gives a strained answer. He promises that everything will be fine. He then addresses Corinne, and they go somewhere a little more private.

Averill gives Ashissa a brotherly pat, watching her snarl her nose predatorily, and advices she to go after her man, especially after she says he’s not hers. He tells her to talk to Fen, to which she wanted to talk to her later.

She begins by mentioning she has a message for him and adds he can confide in her. Anything he tells her will be between them. She then tells him about his curse, Laf’Loran, and his promise. She mistook the jeweler as Myron, but realized that it was his ancestor instead. The cleric admits it’s the closest answer he’s gotten, great news really. Myron thanks her and asks about dreams. She describes her experience, art comes to life, and she witnesses a plethora of colors, artistic mediums, styles, etc. 

>Whatever your joy and passion is going to be what you dream — whether it’s about loved ones or, hobbies and passions, or to live through past memories remembering the loved ones that passed. Everyone’s dreams are different and special to that particular person.
>
>— Corinne on dreams

Myron expresses he’s never had one, and merely expressed his curiosity. He believe’s he now has a chance to ask the questions he’s wanted to ask for along time. He thanks her again. He goes back to the helm and pulls Ashissa close 🥰. 

Hours pass, and the boat slows as the flames die down. The sun starts to lower along the horizon. Corinne notices dots along the beach to the right — it’s a large collection of tents. Further inland, a mountain range that separates  as it moves towards the coast. She points it out to us, catching our attention. A chill goes down Ashissa’s spine as she studies the coastline. To our left, we can barely make out an island off in the distance.

We argue some time about how to go about folding the boat. 

>![addon]- The Things Players Say 
>**Fen:** We land the dingy, and then —
>**Moradin:** Why can’t we just—
>**Twin:** Fold it?
>**Fen:** Because when I unfold it, the boat is still ground, and then how the fuck do we get the boat?
>**Twin:** Well walk out a little further and throw it as you do it.
>**Ashissa:** Kind of like a pokéball?
>**Fen:** That’s not how it — a what ball?
>**Averill:** You never heard of pokéballs? You ever heard of a *pocket* monster, Fen?
>**Moradin:** (excitedly) Oh are we talking about pocket monsters?
>**Fen:** (deadpan, so done) No.
>**Jacob:** Get ready y’all; Belda Sil is going to be a Pokémon journey.
>![](https://media.tenor.com/GPY_xF7gVOoAAAAC/gotta-catch-em-all.gif)

Moradin finds some driftwood lying around and begins to build a makeshift dingy. We eventually row to shore, and Fen folds the boat. Corinne dances on the tightly packed dingy, though we advice against it. Fen goes to trip her, but can’t seem to strategically position her foot. Averill, Moradin, and Myron row the boat — Moradin rises as the oars go up. Ashissa stares at Myron’s arms. <span class="spoiler">Noted on request.</span>

>[!info] Folding Paper Boat
> We can move the dingy away from the boat within a certain distance — the ship will come towards the caster in the folding process. Past that distance, the spell can no longer be cast.

We make our way to shore, and feel eyes on us, especially Ashissa. We see a lot of people who look similar to Ashissa, with varying colorations degrees scales, similar skin tones, and more tribal clothing far more revealing than what we’re used to. We begin to understand where Ashissa got her clothing choices from.

She sees a few familiar faces. She hears the term “survivor” whispered in abyssal as we walk. The encampment is not structured as neat rows of tents, making it hard to navigate where we need to go. We pass by a group of Yuan-ti training with various weapons, smaller clusters who are being instructed in medicinal practices, and other small groups in rudimentary magics. It’s a bit more organized than she initially thought.

The looming submission that shadowed the purebloods is present, but there’s been a shift.

Fen casts [[comprehend languages\|comprehend languages]] (<span class="anti glitch"><span>Natural 1</span>Natural 1<span>Natural 1</span></span>), though is somewhat distracted by the mixture of infernal and abyssal in their language. She thinks on the implications of that. Ashissa continues to actively look for her brother. It takes time as she’s a bit distracted, trying to understand what she’s looking for.

We approach the larger tent in the center of the encampment,  go through the opening, and look inside. Though it seemed odd , Ashissa recalls her mother is leading the refugees now met with the reality of the situation.

>An opening that is opened ...
>
>—wisdom from our DM, and our title-card

Several sheets of canvas separate each compartment. Towards the center is a cobbled-together, rough-looking wooden table with various papers and documents on top. We see three figures in the space: [[Zossa\|Zossa]], the ever-so familiar baby brother with focused eyes and a strong build— Ashissa is taken aback by the young man he’s turned into; a familiar older woman, with long graying hair, [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Beatrix\|Triska]] in her full Yuan-ti form; and a young tan-skinned half-elven woman with shorter straight hair wearing flowing traveling clothes with various straps and implements holding beakers, vials, etc. It’s [[Severa\|Severa]], who owns a magic shop in Lindhaven.

Fen bursts into tears upon seeing her old friend. Averill prepares a handkerchief and hands it to the sobbing elf who greets her Severa excitedly. Upon seeing Ashissa, Severa notes that the yuan-ti and Fen know each other — small world. Moradin mistakes the hug as a family reunion and attempts to join, though is stopped as the a few party members warn the two women to stay away from him.

Severa asks their former party members, but Ashissa attempts to lie. The other two parted ways as they had other things to do. Fen and Severa make arrangements to catch up, but first other things are going on. The elven wizard squeals excitedly grabbing Averill, who pats her on the back with a smile. Zossa hugs Ashissa, surprised by our sudden arrival, and the girls mention the magic boat.

Zossa looks to Moradin and notices his new arms, and mentions the [[Headband of intellect\|Headband of intellect]], hoping the forge cleric has put it to good use. Apparently, Moradin modified it as bracelets for his arms 🤦🏽‍♀️. Fen introduces everyone, though when she introduces as Severa as her best friend, Twin states, “That hurts.” 😂

>That hurts, *Pen*. That hurts deep.
>
>— Lexie impersonating Twin

Ashissa takes a moment to see if her gem is reacting to Severa (“Is it heating up a little as I get close to the source?” 🤣). Averill notices Ashissa doing this and recalls her aversion to the half-elf, though decides not to waste a Divine Sense atm. He jokingly whispers to Fen that introducing him as an AWOL Chasmian soldier would have been cooler. She argues she didn’t want to get him in trouble, which prompts him to say he lives for the trouble. 😎

Ashissa has obviously been on edge since we reached shore — she can’t tell if it’s apprehension or nervousness about a meeting she knew was coming, or if it has something to do with the amulet around her neck.

Severa admits she’s known Fen for a long time, though met Ashissa and Myron about three months ago. She points out Ashissa’s new jewelry, which is now more real. Moradin asks for food, feeling famished and Zossa assures him there’s plenty.

Triska admits she remembers all of us, except for Corinne, and changes her form; it’s Beatrix from [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Spenwald\|Spenwald]]. Upon recognizing her, Fen excitedly asks about her [[Charm of Plant Command\|Charm of Plant Command]], which Beatrix happens to be wearing. Conversations and food come first, as Moradin offers to cook for everyone, and Zossa praises the cleric’s culinary skills.

Corinne takes a moment to personally introduce herself to Triska, who asks if the bard has made it to Spenwald at some point of time. Fen excitedly mentions the plant ring, and Corinne assumes the merchant may have more interesting wares or would be interested in playing a game. <span class="spoiler">What in the theives cant? 🤨</span>

Moradin makes tempura tarantulas accompanied with a miso, sauce and an egg drop soup.

>[!addon]- The Things Players Say
>**Lexie:** Noooo~!
>**Crystal:** That feels a little inconsiderate considering the company we’re in.
>**Majesty:** Yeeeaaaah~
>**Chris:** Which makes it —
>**Lexie:** Plentiful.

Ashissa immediately interrogates Severa, pointing out she’s not yuan-ti. Averill points out most of their party isn’t yuan-ti. Ashissa expresses her jealousy once getting the conversation back on track, but wonders why the half-elf is involved. Severa admits she’s friends with Triska, who said she had items she was interested in and vice versa. Though this connection, she met Ashissa’s mother, [[Zeska\|Zeska]]. “So, very strangely, we seem to go further back than I thought.”

“Destiny! It’s almost like it was aligned,” Ashissa responds sarcastically. Fen excitedly watches her two best friends interact, expressing this to Averill, who knows Ashissa is on edge and ready to pounce. Severa asks how she and Fen met — they met at Triksa’s shop. She continues stating that Triska and Zeska asked for assistance in gathering magical items.

Moradin confuses Corinne, and she gets out her henna. Averill out loud hopes they’re flirting, purposely playing a terrible matchmaker and wingman that Moradin claimed he was. While those two clear up the misunderstanding, Averill explains to Severa he has a dry sense of humor. 

Severa offers comfort to Fen, admitting she knows what happened to Elliot. She lets the wizard know she’s here if she needs to talk and Ashissa also offers. “Yeah pick *one* of them,” Twin adds. 😂

Zossa then addresses Ashissa, believing she has questions. He asks her what she knows as of now, and she relays she knows that their mother is currently scouting.

>[!addon]- The Things Players Say
>**Fen:** I heard sleep with her for a second and I was like—?
>**Ashissa:** We don’t do that in our tribe. ... That’s a different tribe.
>**Zossa:** Yep.
>**Jacob:** That’s the island next door. 😅😂
>**Lexie:** Bro’da Sil 🤣 
>**Jacob:** That’s the bro.
>**Lexie:** That’s the Kentucky of the island.
>**Moradin:** Roll tide!

As she renews her henna, Corinne hears a voice in her head. “It has been some time. He thinks well of you.” The bard asks what’s happening and if *he* is doing well — he’s as well as he could be considering there’s a lot going on in the city. The voice promises to recommend that he may reach out to her soon.

Zossa attempts to inquire more for Ashissa, but she knows little outside of what we’re doing. She points out he’s obviously been training. She asks if they (the refugees) will do anything soon (i.e. fight back). Though they have been organizing for some time, the half-bloods and abnormalities have many capabilities that make them very strong. The purebloods hoped to close that gap by getting assistance through their friends and magical means. Though numerous, they are not as strong. Zossa argues that individuals not bound to the island would help their people overcome those difficulties.

Zeska went to the island the day before to look for weaknesses in their organization for the purebloods to exploit. They haven’t heard from her for some time. Severa attempted a few hours ago, but had no success in getting a response. Fen concludes something happened after Ashissa spoke with her, narrowing down the timeline. Ashissa suggests we go to the island as soon as possible.

Zossa and Triska share a look for a moment. They cannot leave with the condition of the camp — the people are just now beginning to get their confidence back. Zossa admits they have tried to find another solution, though states that we arrived at an opportune time. He suggests we go to the island and finish the mission she was on. He believes a small group can sneak in and out easier than a whole army.

Twin mentions burning the island to the ground, though possibly starting at the tower, launching the conversation to shift to our intended mission. Averill uses divine sense as Ashissa describes the details to the others. He senses some fiendish energy on both Triska and Severa, unsure if it is them, or something on them. Unfortunately, he is distracted by the glow of the god gems in a confined space. [[Laf’Loran’s Geode\|Laf’Loran’s Geode]] and [[Path in Purgatory/Items/Gaelira’s Emerald\|Gaelira’s Emerald]] are now exuding purely celestial energy.

Fen admits we stopped by to get more intel about the island, specifically Zeska’s information. Ashissa asks for the specifics of her mother’s mission. Zeska was looking for weaknesses with the temple, which is separate from the tower.

>[!info] Belda Sil
>In the middle of the island is a lake where the Tower of Fate, a god tower, stands. A land bridge connects the tower to a temple.

Fen asks about recent info in regards to the temple, the gods, and the tower. Zossa admits it’s been a while since they left the island. The pureblood refugees were concerned that the abominations and half-bloods were going to follow, however the religious practices kept them from leaving. Instead, They had chosen to put themselves in a defensive stance around the temple. The abominations, or those more closely aligned with their god ([[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Karaz’khil\|Karaz’khil]]), are within the temple, while the half-bloods patrol around it.

Fen asks if there’s another way to the temple, bypassing the land bridge. Zossa does not recommend trying it.

For generations through fear, those who adhered to the anathema, the furmost servants of [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Karaz’khil\|Karaz’khil]], kept the purebloods away from the waters of the lake. Until recently, they were very successful. Few purebloods stayed behind and fought. Having upon bomg overwhelmed, they grew too close to the lake, and the waters are certainly a means of findinding one’s own demise. Zossa then adds that they believe that is what happened to Ashissa and her father. “Those waters reek of death.”

Corinne offers to provide not only good distraction, but great cover with [[Fog Cloud\|Fog Cloud]] and to turn two people [[invisible\|invisible]]. Paired with Averill’s blindsight, and Twin’s stealth, we start the makings of a supposedly excellent plan on how to deal with the island. However, Twin is still somewhat exhausted. Fen suggests we not go at night, however it could be a good idea. Zossa feels more confident with night.

We discuss little details — there’s some urgency, so going tonight would be best to locate Zeska as soon as possible. Zossa admits she’s a highly capable person, however may have tangled herself in an uncompromisable position. We discuss killing the guards or only sneaking past. While killing is not the goal, it’s not frowned upon either.

Ashissa mentions her [[Eversmoking bottle\|Eversmoking bottle]], though Fen doesn’t want to loose more magic items. Averill suggests she use her [[Sneeze Dust\|Sneeze Dust]] so long as she’s careful with it. Might even help with our escape plan. Dejectedly, Ashissa admits we have to do go. Fen recounts our efforts in trying to get to Dham Auram on time for Moradins’ family — the offer would obviously be extended to Ashissa. ♥️

We’ll go tonight but stock up on a few items, including ✨ magic items ✨. Averill leans towards Ashissa and tells her about his Divine Sense findings, however he doesn’t feel absolutely confident about it.

Corinne asks about magic items, especially something that will allow her to have fun or allow one to sneak. As the shopkeepers take stock of their inventory, the bard notes that the ring Fen covets would be good for when we reach the island. Moradin gats an alchemy vibe off of Severa, and asks for diamond dust adding a bit of flirtation. We warn Severa to be careful, though she can take care of herself.

Triska shows Corinne the [[Cape of the Mountebank\|Cape of the Mountebank]] — it can get her and one other person from here to there (350 gp).

Twin asks about something to lessen his exhaustion. Triska admits she may have a spell, but she would need to spend some costly elements (200 gp). Once Ashissa pays, the shopkeeper waves diamond dust in the air, casting [[Greater Restoration\|Greater Restoration]].

Sevara offers Moradin 200 gold worth of diamond dust for  250 gp.

<span class="floaterR">
	<img alt="" height="200" src="https://media.tenor.com/-f3FBy_N3eoAAAAC/shutupandtakemymoney-money.gif">
</span>

Triska addresses Fen, offering the [[Charm of Plant Command\|Charm of Plant Command]] for 350 gp. Fen doesn’t argue. Twin, however, feeling rejuvenated secretly swipes the ring off the wizard and hides it in Ashissa’s pocket.

Averill vaguely asks about a magic items, unsure of what to shop for but wanting something that will help the party. Twin unknowingly takes the ring back from Ashissa and hands it back to Fen.

Corinne will talk to Triska later.

Moradin attempts to get information from Severa about alchemy, asking for recipes to make stuff as he would like to attempt to make his own elixirs.

>**Lexie:** I’m not letting you waste your d12 on a cook book.
>**Chris:** But it’s alchemy!
>**Lexie:** I said what I said. 😂

She considers, though wants to make sure he can comprehend it first. He purrs with conviction. 🚩 Severa, though she appears to be in her late 20s, tells Moradin she’s married upon recognizing his intentions. It’s never been a problem before. 🚩🚩🚩

>“Uncanny valley” is a term  when a human-like robot is a little too “perfecty” and it makes you feel weird. I feel like in terms of attractiveness that’s Moradin. Like he’s *so* attractive that it weirds people out a little bit. That’s what a 14/10 is. “In this phenomenon, people feel a sense of unease or even revulsion in response to humanoid robots that are highly realistic.” [^1]

>—Crystal on Moradin’s attractiveness

Corinne asks about healing potions, and Sevara has a few she planned to donate to the cause. In regards to her recipes, she suggests we finish the mission at hand, *then* Moradin can talk to her. Fen points out he can’t have all of her time.

Ashissa asks if Triska has armor, though her own is better than what the shopkeeper has on hand. Upon hearing Triska may have more powerful armor, Averill’s interest is piqued though he wants to be careful of tapping into his inheritance. Recalling, Twin seemed to be familiar with the Dubois, the solider inquires if he know if his family did any shady business in the past/present. “You have a girlfriend that’s pregnant?” 🤦🏽‍♀️ Twin then mistakes Ashissa as his girlfriend, or rather confuses Averill for Myron once again. 🫠

Averill attempts to clarify, and mentions talking about it later. Twin asks if they worked with the [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/True Fathoms\|True Fathoms]], something Averill wants to find out and then some. <span class="spoiler">Perhaps, Twin can one day pay Averill back that 1.5k gp he dropped for the tabaxi’s armor 😉. I’m reaching but a dreamer can dream.</span>

As this goes on, Corinne looks at some pricey items, and asks for a ring that would help with buffs. Triska offers a [[ring of protection\|ring of protection]], though Corinne isn’t comfortable with the price and pays 300 gp.

Triska asks Averill to be more specific about what he wants. Truthfully, he’s just curious, but anything that could help him defend his friends is a plus. After some thought, she offers the soldier the a choice between the [[ring of evasion\|ring of evasion]] for 300 gp,  [[ring of shooting stars\|ring of shooting stars]] for 3,000 gp. Despite claiming he was saving for “things” and that he’s frugal, he spends the 300 pp.

>**Lexie:** You said screw saving up for a house ... gimme that ring!
>**Majesty:** I still — even if I bought it, I still have enough money for something. We’ll figure it out.
>**Zerai:** How do you have enough money?
>**Lexie:** 4 dealerships! Like I’m about to marry Averill.

Ashissa offers 50 gold to Averill, but he doesn’t take it, stating Twin still owes him for his armor. “The statute of limitations have passed on that.” Averill hints they’ll work on it, possibly hinting he may have a job for him in the future. 🤷🏽‍♀️ 

Severa mentions she may have a few spells for Fen, who drools at the thought. She asks about what level, and obviously she’ll give a discount (i.e. [[Arcane Gate\|Arcane Gate]], [[Magic Jar\|Magic Jar]], [[Otiluke's Freezing Sphere\|Otiluke's Freezing Sphere]], etc.).

>[!addon]- It really be your own friends 😭
Upon Severa mentioning Magic Jar as something that could bite one in the butt if used wrong, Ashissa mumbles it sounds like something Averill is into. Confused, he asks her to elaborate, questioning what she thinks goes on in his head.  She says he’s a bit sadistic, which he doesn’t deny, though it depends on his target (fighting opponent). 
>
>She meant Zuri which he quickly denies. When he mentioned she beat him up it wasn’t like that. She asks who leads, and he’s taken aback as it’s obvious everyone knows that was their first time. It gets too personal for him to respond as Ashissa and Corinne gang up on him and paint him as kinky. He begs them to stop.  <span class="spoiler">Y’all leave my boi alone. 😭😭😭</span>
>
>Rather than being teased, he suggests if they’re so curious, they should ask Zuri — have a girl talk. Ashissa says it’d be weird especially because she doesn’t see him that way and that’s why he trusts her implicitly.

After listing the spells, Severa offers them to Fen for 3500 gp. While she says she’s no Averill, not even he can help her now 😅. Averill admits he’s not loaded, his family is. Severa and Fen continue to talk about spells, coming up with a reasonable list (1000–1500 gp). Ashissa offers as Fen’s “really good friend” to help pay, handing her 300 gp despite telling Averill not but a minute ago that one shouldn’t buy love. Corinne adds 5 gp.

Ashissa attempts to trade off her pan flute, but both Fen and Averill demand she put it back on her person. They remind her it’s sentimental.

Fen attempts to pay Severa 1300 gp, but he will only accept 1000 gp from her friend. 

>*It finally dawns on Crystal that Severa is married.*
>**Lexie:** She’s married to Elliot’s brother, Shmelliot.
>**Crystal:** Elliot is an only child like Fen.
>**Lexie:** *Oh*, we’re still believing *everything* he says? 🫢
>*We totally get off track and the laughs keep coming.*

Triska offers something fun for 300 gp to Ashissa, who doesn’t ask what it is. She hands Ashissa [[Dimensional Shackles\|Dimensional Shackles]] — they prevent a creature from using any method of extradimensional movement, however they must be incapacitated.

Moradin gets handed some alchemic info from Severa (<span class="party glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span> 🥳).

#todo/purgatory
- [ ] Ask Ashissa, Zossa, Severa, and Triska what weakness we can physically exploit on the half-bloods, abominations, and anathema.
- [ ] Work out some of Zuri’s backstory (i.e. adption, etc.).
- [ ] Get Lexie to watch the *Aristocats*.
