>In the middle of the night after the midnight scry, Moradin decides to force Fen to move on from Elliot through the aid of alchemical and magical means. Unfortunately, he gets caught by Averill, who shows him no mercy. Morning comes, and Averill explains last night’s shenanigans to *sober* Fen. Corinne joins the conversation, and the conversation reveals she may be interested in Averill. Despite all the antics, the Nameless Ones prepare for their encounter with Luthais, eventually finding themselves in an unpopulated Aden Vala. They locate the underground tunnels and fight with Duke Elnaril and four hags.


</div></div>


The Nameless Ones stand before a pair of stone doors decorated with runic sequences around the edges, artistic depictions carved within the stone. The left door appears to depict the Ten Ascendant, representing the glory of the world before the Blight Year; the right door depicts the land destroyed, corrupted, ablaze in flame, ravaged — the before and after of the events.

Fen angrily disses Luthais ideals and dedication to the Void Walkers. Ashissa notes that it’s blasphemous. Averill attempts to play devil’s advocate by relating the door as a record of history, implying Luthais was deceived (senile) and angry with the gods.

Ashissa and Averill attempt to open the left door with no luck. Averill goes open the right door — it’s heavy — and Moradin comes to help. As the door slowly opens, Averill barely notices a faint purple miasma in the air. With his Divine Sense, he notices that the further we go the fiendish presence grows. He feels a familiar burning sensation akin to his recent training in the [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Sky Pillar\|Sky Pillar]] — we are being watched and the fiendish presence is interested in us, probably [[Gra’zzt\|Gra’zzt]]. Ashissa sarcastically adds she loves being watched. 👀👀👀

Twin looks inside, it’s hard to make out a lot of detail in the dimly lit room. The doorways open to a small flight of stairs that raise upwards, making it hard to see anything on the floor. Beyond there are a few pillars that raise to the ceiling and there are a couple statues. Averill raises an ablaze [[Path in Purgatory/Items/Sun Shadow\|Sun Shadow]] to produce more light.

The room is lit with greens and purples. We walk up the flight of stairs entering an antechamber that opens to a wider space. To the center of the room is a bowl-like circle — similar to the one in the tree — that has a combination of old blood and more fresh blood. The four pillars were at one point carved stone. Towards the back of the room are two brazier; one lit with a green flame the other purple. Next to them are two massive stone statues — the left reminiscent to [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Laf’Loran\|Laf’Loran]]; the right more decrepit, stone has fallen apart, appears fiendish in form (Gra’zzt).

There is another door to the opposite end and towards the back left corner is another door. Fen approaches the center to inspect the space. It appears as though there was a recent drain as there was in the tree.

Moradin inspects the statues. The stone is limestone, though the outside is fragile like granite. There was some sort of transmutation magic to produce the stone — not natural.

Twin goes to check the left door, though it’s locked. He attempts to unlock the door and barely manages to open it. Inside he sees another flight of stairs (short) that descends down into a space. Twin notices something shining giving a purple glow

Moradin and Averill’s echo go down into the dimly lit space. It’s a square shaped room with carpet that covers the floor soaked in blood. There are two more doors. At the center of the room appears to be a key, hovering above the carpet that gives off a purple glow.

Twin checks the other door, unlocks it there is a puff over him. He then feels very sleepy.

Ashissa and Moradin attempt to grab the key with Mage Hand but the hands dissolve. She then goes to attack it with Erdrich Blast, and it dissolves around it.

Averill goes up and finds Twin passed out. He is magically asleep ... the octopus attempts to wake him to no avail. Averill applies Lay on Hands and Twin wakes, immediately looking into the door. 

He sees another set of stairs that descend into another space with braziers, that is slightly more rectangular in shape. He sees a stone desk with a stone chair behind it. He sees papers, beakers that contain jet black fluid and others a sickly purplish glow. On the desk there is an open leather bound book.

Twin shuts the door and lays down some ball bearings. We meet up with the rest of the group.

The blood in the room is old. Moradin attempts to open the doors with mage hand and they don’t open. Twin goes to unlock the left but has some difficulty, he opens the right and he sees a hallway with a door to the right and archs to the right. Corinne unlocks the left door.

Averill begins to recall how the underground reminds him of his dreams and begins to dissociate ... Ashissa offers to help him unpack at another time.

Twin touches the key with his sword, but it’s like pressing towards a stone wall.

We open the left door, we see another hallway, the door is more ornate with 3 glowing circles, red green blue and at the center there is an indentation.

Moradin casts [[dispel magic\|dispel magic]] on the key. The purple glow fizzles out and falls to the ground.

Fen, Averill and Twin go back up to the research room. There are no doors. Fen begins to look at the books. The leather bound book is very old leather ... she opens it and its a journal.

Volu expresses his disappointment with the gods and how he was approached and seduced Gra’zzt. Later he was approached by Arcanis who introduced them to the Void Walkers.

The Grand Gate ...

Moradin grabs the now disenchanted key.

Twin inspects the ornate door. There is a magical circle ... the indentation appears random, though as he blinks they transition. Fen attempts to press the key to the door.

Moradin goes back up to check on the beakers and their substances. He finds that the black ichor is congealed blood that has went through an alchemical process that has turned it darker. He sees similar substances that give off a purplish glow. The blood has gone through rituals that have infused it with fiendish blood.

Twin tries the door to the right with the key and it opens. A 20 x 20 foot room with corpses at various degrees, some are skeletons, mumified, very old bodies. Twin sees a gentle red glow beneath the bodies.

Every one of the bodies appear to be elven. A few have manacles around the wrist.

The way is cleared that shows red glowing magical circle. Fen inspects it and finds that it’s enchantment — a mind altering kind of magic ... some of the runes are akin to magic that evoke sleep.

Fen feels compelled to touch the circle and enters the nightmare room. Her vision goes completely black and suddenly she sees greenery popping up. It’s picturesque. To the left she sees a large mountain and to the right  another large mountain as the Twin mountains that have the monestaries ... Vertas ... she sees a pulsing force in front of her.

Next to her she sees a human man, Elliot, with his hair pulled back, determination to understand something. He steps forward to the field. She attempts to stop him, but she is kept still. He steps forward and presses forward as his form dissolves. The sequence repeats. He then asks why she doesn’t stop him. It loops and then it goes black again.

She is filled with fear and dread and cannot shake. The circle dissipates. Ashissa casts calm emotions on Fen but it does not pull her out.

The red circle on the door is now dim. We go to the other doors realizing we need to deactivate other circles.

There is a greenish magic circle. There is rubble, though relatively empty. Averill sends his echo and finds his mind wandering. He remembers a time when he’s young, full of dreams and aspirations. He tries to pull his attention back and he feels alternate versions of him pulling as well ... he is hit with all his hidden regrets. <span class="spoiler">What if he pursued a more political career? What if he put Darina in her place? What if he stayed and moved up in rank? What if he pursued his relationship with Zuri openly?</span> Welcome to the Daydream room.

He looks exhausted. We go to the next door with the blue glow. In the center there is a dais like structure with a mirror. There is another door to the right.

Moradin approaches the dais reaching out to the blue glow above ... welcome to the Lucid Room. Moradin disappears. He finds himself in a 25 x 25 foot space. He sees an exact copy of himself that extends the blades from his sword shields. He combats himself.

He eventually smashes the mirror duplicate and it crumbles. He returns to the room, somewhat battered. The blue circle fizzles out.

Twin goes to the other door and the space appears to be a natural cave system. It’s a bit warmer and humid, as though we’re taking a breath outside. There’s a warmer glow.

All three lights are out, but there is the central indentation. The room opens to a larger cave system. There is grass on the ground, no sunlight, there are gently golden glowing trees that each have an almost apple shaped fruit. The trees block a direct line of sight.

Corinne gracefully dances to the trees, a gentle yellow pollen falls. Her pupils dilate and she appears transfixed, she grabs the fruit and takes a bite. She offers us to take a bite and throws it to Moradin. The pollen touches his skin and feel the compulsion. Suddenly she believes that Volu isn’t such a bad guy.

Averill casts [[daylight\|daylight]], brightening up the space. Some pollen falls on Fen and she picks an apple, though Averill is able to quickly hit it out of her hand. They retreat back into the Lucid room.

Twin and Ashissa make it to the other side and finds a dais that violently shakes and change to a different form. Ashissa attempts to mage hand the dais and accomplishes what she did.

Ashissa places the dais into the door, and it opens. We see a rectangular space about 50 x 70–80 feet with a raised half-circle platform. The room is worse for wear. There are five pillars though one has collasped. There is a stone constructed throne at the end of the  room. The room is better lit and there is a purple light emanating through. On the semi circle there is the stone constructed dais and a gently pulsing orb of black energy — it is familiar to Twin and Moradin.

We feel an immense pressure of presence, greater than any divine presence we have felt before, emanating from the orb. Sitting on the throne is Sovreign Luthais, staring out, eyes glazed over. We see a figure laying on the semicirlce in front of the dais ... it’s Inara as though as all of the moisture was pulled out of her body.

“I gave it ... I gave it everything ... ”

Averill looks at him with empathy as Luthais comes to the realization he was deceived. Luthais stands, takes a step forward labored. His head twists, his arms fall. Gra’zzt possesses him as his skin darkens ... horns grow, as does an extra finger on each of his hands. He grabs a massive notched sword.

Fen attempts to cast fireball, but Gra’zzt’s eyes glow purple, and her magic fizzles out. We immediately enter into combat.

Gra’zzt charms Moradin and compels him to move closer to the dais. Ashissa sprouts draconic-owl wings with her form of fate.

Averill hits Gra’zzt (natural 20).

Twin does some serious damage (natural 20), and upon realizing he’s surrounded, Gra’zzt teleports behind Ashissa. Moradin moves away from the dais and casts bless, allowing Ashissa to attack (natural 20). He attempts to charm Ashissa, but she’s able to shake it off (DC 23). He immediately attempts it again, casting Dominate Person on her and advices her to kill her friends.

Fen attacks and moves away, but Gra’zzt teleports after her and uses his lair actions. Corinne attempts to move away and he charms her to move closer to the dais. Her life essence pours out of her body.

Ashissa attempts to hit Twin, Averill and Myron but misses horribly.

Gra’zzt attempts seduces Fen to kill us as well. Averill runs up and uses Solar Plexus and begins to wail on him (natural 20) — Ashissa is released from Gra’zz’s hold. Gra’zzt attempts slashes him back with as much force.

Myron activates Twilight Sanctuary. Corinne moves away from the dais and hides.

Another natural 20 for Averill, as Moradin casts Healling Word, allowing him to strike Gra’zzt. He pulls at the orb and it radiates a pulse, dealing a large amount of necrotic damage on all of us. He then teleports behind Ashissa, he then compels Averill to attack his friends.

Ashissa attempts thunder step but he  casts counterspell. Averill then begins to attack Twin and Fen. Thankfully, he hits Twin’s duplicates and misses Fen. (natural 20)

Myron comes towards Gra’zzt to defend Ashissa (natural 20). Moradin successfully releases Averill from the Dominate Person, and moves closer to Gra’zzt. He disappears for a moments and pulls at the stone, sending out another necrotic pulse.

He goes to attack Averill, who uses the last of his resources to defeat him. As he grabs the geode, the purple energy dissipates. The orb lashes for a moment before it collapses in on itself.

Averill goes blind as his newfound ability deactivates.
