>In the middle of the night after the midnight scry, Moradin decides to force Fen to move on from Elliot through the aid of alchemical and magical means. Unfortunately, he gets caught by Averill, who shows him no mercy. Morning comes, and Averill explains last night’s shenanigans to *sober* Fen. Corinne joins the conversation, and the conversation reveals she may be interested in Averill. Despite all the antics, the Nameless Ones prepare for their encounter with Luthais, eventually finding themselves in an unpopulated Aden Vala. They locate the underground tunnels and fight with Duke Elnaril and four hags.


</div></div>


The Nameless Ones stand before a pair of stone doors decorated with runic sequences around the edges, artistic depictions carved within the stone. The left door appears to depict the Ten Ascendant, representing the glory of the world before the Blight Year; the right door depicts the land destroyed, corrupted, ablaze in flame, ravaged — the before and after of the events.

Fen angrily disses Luthais ideals and dedication to the Void Walkers. Ashissa notes that it’s blasphemous. Averill attempts to play devil’s advocate by relating the door as a record of history, implying Luthais was deceived (senile) and angry with the gods.

Ashissa and Averill attempt to open the left door with no luck. Averill goes open the right door — it’s heavy — and Moradin comes to help. As the door slowly opens, Averill barely notices a faint purple miasma in the air. With his Divine Sense, he notices that the further we go the fiendish presence grows. He feels a familiar burning sensation akin to his recent training in the [[Path in Purgatory/Locations/Sky Pillar\|Sky Pillar]] — we are being watched and the fiendish presence is interested in us, probably [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Graz’zt (PP)\|Graz’zt]]. Ashissa sarcastically adds she loves being watched. 👀👀👀

Twin looks inside, it’s hard to make out a lot of detail in the dimly lit room. The doorways open to a small flight of stairs that raise upwards, making it hard to see anything on the floor. Beyond there are a few pillars that raise to the ceiling and there are a couple statues. Averill raises an ablaze [[Path in Purgatory/Items/Sun Shadow\|Sun Shadow]] to produce more light.

The room is lit with greens and purples. We walk up the flight of stairs entering an antechamber that opens to a wider space. To the center of the room is a bowl-like circle — similar to the one in the tree — that has a combination of old blood and more fresh blood. The four pillars were at one point carved stone. Towards the back of the room are two brazier; one lit with a green flame the other purple. Next to them are two massive stone statues — the left reminiscent to [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Laf’Loran\|Laf’Loran]]; the right more decrepit, stone has fallen apart, appears fiendish in form (Graz’zt).

There is another door to the opposite end and towards the back left corner is another door. Fen approaches the center to inspect the space. It appears as though there was a recent drain as there was in the tree.

Moradin inspects the statues. The stone is limestone, though the outside is fragile like granite. There was some sort of transmutation magic to produce the stone — not natural.

Twin goes to check the left door, though it’s locked. He attempts to unlock the door and barely manages to open it. Inside he sees another short flight of stairs that descends down into another space. Twin notices a large carpet and something shining giving a slight purple glow (darn disadvantage, a poor natural 20 wasted 😢).

As a group, we agree to not deplete our resources more than we have so that we may be prepared for our eventual encounter with Luthais. Fen brings up her martial prowess and Averill offers his other longsword ([[Longsword, +1\|Longsword, +1]]), hoping she has something just in case she runs out of spells. She assures him she has a dagger and a cantrips up her sleeve.

Moradin and Averill’s echo (via Echo Avatar, leaving Averill blind and deaf) go down into the dimly lit space — the flames from the sword brighten the space. It’s a square shaped room with carpet that covers the floor soaked in blood. 😅 There are two more doors to the left and right. At the center of the room appears to be a key, hovering above the carpet that gives off a purple glow. 🫠 Moradin contemplates whether he or the echo should grab the key.

Twin checks the other door, unlocks it there is a puff over him. He suddenly feels drowsy, on top of his exhaustion, and falls asleep. His octopus attempts to wake him to no avail.

The rest of the group joins Moradin in the smaller room, and Averill returns his consciousness back to his own body. Ashissa and Moradin attempt to grab the key with [[Mage Hand\|Mage Hand]] but the hands dissolve. She then goes to attack it with [[Eldritch Blast\|Eldritch Blast]], and it dissolves around it.

Averill goes up, finds Twin passed out and the other door slightly ajar. The octopus continues to smack him on the face, however he is magically asleep. Averill applies Lay on Hands to neutralize the effects and Twin wakes, immediately looking into the door, ignoring the soldier.

Twin sees another set of stairs that descend into another space with two more braziers lit with purple and green light; though the room is slightly more rectangular in shape. He sees a long rectangular, stone desk with a stone chair behind it, possibly an office of sorts. There are several different loose papers strewn about, beakers that contain jet black fluid and others a sickly purplish glow. Noticeably on the desk, there is an open leather-bound book.

Twin shuts the door and lays down some ball bearings, setting a quick trap. We meet up with the rest of the group.

Moradin notices that the blood in the room is *old*, no fresh blood nor a body in sight. He pulls the rug up to investigate more, not really finding anything of interest. He attempts to open the doors with [[mage hand\|mage hand]] and they don’t open. 

Twin informs the group about the office as he and Averill enter the key room, and goes to unlock the left door, but has some difficulty. Intrigued, Fen gets ready to leave, wanting to check out the book, but Twin and Averill warn her about his trap; Averill also expresses his dislike of separating the party, letting her know he found Twin passed out. Though the group makes light of this considering his extreme exhaustion. Fen expresses her desire to read the “book of secrets,” to which the soldier suggests they check it out *after* they get out alive.

He opens the right door and he sees a hallway with another door to the right, and the hallway archs and extends to the left. Corinne unlocks the left door with ease — Twin nonchalantly takes credit. 😅

Averill begins to recall how the underground reminds him of his dreams. He receives silent concern from a few members within earshot. “Save it for the boat!” Twin exclaims as he continues to investigate. 🤣

Ashissa offers to help him unpack his dreams another time, specifically with a dream journal, claiming she has some understanding passed down from her mother . She asks a few leading questions, wondering if his dreams are “normal” for him. He goes quiet and retreats into his mind, dissociating upon the revelation and similar imagery. 🩸🩸🩸

Twin attempts to the key with his sword, which does not glow indicating it is not sentient, but it’s like pressing towards a stone wall. He then goes to open the left door. There’s another hallway with a door immediately to the right and another larger ornate door with three glowing circles — red, green and blue — on the opposite side. At the center there is an indentation.

Moradin begins to inspect the key, which is metallic in construction — obviously there’s magic radiating off of it. He casts [[dispel magic\|dispel magic]] on the key. The purple glow fizzles out and the key falls to the ground. He grabs the now disenchanted key.

Meanwhile, Fen, Twin and Averill go back up to the research room. Twin checks his ballbearings which remain untampered, though the one on the handle had fallen, and begins to pick them up. Fen walks inside and begins to look for the book, which is made with very old leather. <span class="spoiler"><em>Tink</em>.</span> Twin investigates the room, finding no traps, but makes a comment about traps being a myth, prompting Averill to ask about the ball bearings — not a trap, but a *detection* apparatus.

She opens the book and finds that it’s Volu’s journal. “Journals can offer insight into the soul,” Averill states. She reads the last entry out-loud, with ✨ commentary ✨.

>[!quote] Volu’s Journal Entry
>Reticent. That is how I find myself in the current world. Unsure and unable to discern. Yet I hold to that which I once knew. That must be enough. Even in the face of these misguided fools who would preserve the status quo in the face of unyielding consumption, I will hold to my goal, my vision, my dream.
>
>I dreamed last night of the days before the great calamity, before the Blight Year. My suspicion of the gods, my leaning away from their teachings, Gaelira’s failure to protect us in the face of cataclysm. In those early days of the new world, I remember the fear on my people’s faces — the sense of betrayal. Why had they forsaken us?
>
>In my anger, I was approached by him. I still remember as though it were a breath away. The beautiful demon who showed me another path. He told me of this land’s doomed destruction, and in the face of such evil, how could I deny it? He knew of this Empty One, witnessed his fall and had felt his all-consuming hunger which would one day retake the world. 
>
>He sympathized with my condition when the gods fled. He helped me formulate a way to eventually save my people, a slow stockpile of blood that would preserve my kind once able to be consumed and converted. I needed only wait for the door he promised would make itself apparent.
>
>And then, many a century later I found myself approached by the one I still only know as Arcanis. His invitation to join a new collection of people discontent with the world the gods left us was tempting by nature and Graz’zt concurred. Over those centuries, I had the people embrace Laf’loran, that god of chaos who’s domain would make Graz’zt’s influence much less apparent. I sought his gem and harnessed his power and created a realm of perfect dreams for my people. Yet it still could not save them from the impending doom.
>
>Some left, discontent with my imperfect paradise and I don’t blame them. Even so, the greater truth still remains. To less lived people it would not be so apparent, but the world has been slowly dying for centuries, like a bear in hibernation that cannot awaken. Even as civilizations have been rebuilt, the once grand world we knew has fallen ever deeper — it’s energy siphoned slowly. The land is in pain without its true creator and it must be remade. It is inevitable. We only prolong it with our “faith.”
>
>Arcanis has provided the technology needed to open the Grand Gate. My people will be free of this doomed world, and I will witness its revival. Perhaps then we shall return ...
>
>Please forgive me, my old friends. I only ever wished for your safety, peace, and happiness.

Fen expresses how delusional Luthais is, wondering how could he come to such conclusions. Averill attempts to play devil’s advocate, considering the sovereign was seduced and misled. He steers the conversation towards the Grand Gate and how it may relate to the Void Gates. Fen concludes that Luthais has been murdering elves and fey for generations, and Averill adds that the Void Gates need sacrifices.

<span class="spoiler">In <a class="internal-link" href="Session 019 - 10152021">Session 19</a>, we learned from the Council of Dragons that <a class="internal-link" href="Baraban">Baraban</a> originally made the Void Gates to permanently kill off the demons from the Abyss, who initially respawned after dying on the material plane. However, the catalyst was fey blood.</span> Refer to [[Path in Purgatory/Path in Purgatory#Theories\|Theories No. 1 & 2]] for more “information.”

Twin gestures they leave the room to go inspect the ornate door. We reconvene with the rest of the group, who Fen then informs about Volu’s journal. Twin inspects the door, noticing a magical circle in which the three circles rotate around; strange indentations appear at random, though as he blinks, they shift back into place. He deduces some type of object should sit in the space, though it is not the same shape as the key, and points this out to the group.

Fen attempts to press the key into the door, at Twin’s suggestion despite his investigation.

Moradin goes back up to check on the beakers and their various substances. He finds that the black ichor is congealed blood that has went through an alchemical process that has turned it darker. He sees similar substances that give off a purplish glow. The blood has gone through rituals that have infused it with fiendish energy. He stashes a few of the beakers into his bag.

Twin tries the door to the right with the key, for a second there’s a reddish glow and it opens. We find a 20 x 20 foot room filled with corpses at various degrees of decomposition; some are skeletons, others mummified — these are very *old* bodies. Twin barely sees the gentle red glow beneath the bodies, which appear to be elven and a few have manacles around the wrist.

Ashissa clears the way with [[Eldritch Blast\|Eldritch Blast]] and reveals a glowing red magical circle, the center appears to be glowing the brightest. Fen warns us not to touch as she inspects it, and finds that it’s an enchantment, mind altering magic. Some of the runes and sequences are akin to magic that evoke sleep. She wonders if the elves at the entrance are under similar magics.

<span class="sticky red">Crystal proceeds to then roll a Natural 1 on her Wisdom Save 😭</span>

She then feels compelled to touch the circle, both Ashissa and Averill go to catch her, but she unfortunately enters the Nightmare Room. Her vision goes completely black and suddenly she sees greenery and trees popping up. It’s very picturesque. In stark contrast to everything around her, to the left she sees a large mountain and to the right  another large mountain. She recognizes the twin mountains that carry the monasteries of Elysium Avertas. 

In front of her, she sees a pulsing force, like a force field of sorts. Next to her she sees a familiar human man, [[Path in Purgatory/NPCs/Elliot Mithalvarin\|Elliot]], with rugged facial hair and his long brown locks pulled back, focused and determined to understand what was in front of him. He steps forward towards the field. She attempts to stop him, screaming, but she is kept still, incapable of reaching him as she is tied to the motions of the moment. He steps forward and presses through as his form dissolves. The scene repeats. He turns mouthing, “Why aren’t you stopping me?” It loops again, and again. Suddenly everything goes black again; she’s back in the space with us.

<span class="spoiler">Later it is revealed that Fen waited for weeks for Elliot to return until one of the monks retrieved her, letting her know she couldn’t go on like that.</span>

From our perspectives, we saw her freeze up for a moment. We attempt to shake her, but she doesn’t respond. Eventually she comes back to herself, bawling and full of dread; she is [[frightened\|frightened]]. Even still, the memory continues to loop in her mind rent free. The circle dissipates. Averill gently asks if she’s okay, only receiving a shake in response. Ashissa casts [[calm emotions\|calm emotions]] on Fen but it does not pull her out, serving as a temporary relief.

We exit the room and find that the red circle on the door is now dim. Averill attempts to comfort Fen. “We’re going to get through this, okay?”

<span class="sticky left green">Let it be on record that we barely got through this. 😅</span>

We go to the other doors realizing we need to deactivate other circles. Twin uses the key to open the next door and sees a green pulse. In the center of the room is a greenish magic circle gently swirling. There is rubble all about, though the room is relatively empty. Fen warns us not to touch it and backs out of the room, though Twin suggests Averill’s shadow go touch it. Moradin throws a rock at the center; it skips and nothing happens.

Averill sends his echo hoping to trick the magic but finds his own mind wandering. He remembers a time when he was young, full of dreams, aspirations, and ambitions. He begins to imagine what it would be like if he had accomplished his goals. The sensation is uncomfortable as he tries to pull his attention back and he feels alternate versions of himself pulling as well, as though there is a tug of war going on in his mind. He is hit with all his hidden regrets and the different ways his life could have been. 

<span class="spoiler">What would have happened if he pursued a more political career in Chasmia? What if he had properly used his connections? What if he put Darina in her place? How far in the chain of command he would have been if he stayed and didn’t abandon his post? How much more fulfilled would he have been if he pursued his relationship with Zuri earlier and more openly?</span> 


All of the “what ifs” flood his mind as he finds himself in the Daydream Room. He becomes taxed with his thoughts, unable to evade them as his mind races through different scenarioes. He looks exhausted — taking a level of [[exhaustion\|exhaustion]]. The silent soldier appears somber and more pensive than usual, eerily so. The green circle dissipates.

Ashissa goes back to inspect the ornate door and finds that the green light has dimmed, confirming our suspicions.

We head to the next door, which Twin unlocks and sees a gentle blue glow. A bit larger than the previous room, there is a swirling blue circle, however, in the center there is a dais-like structure with a mirror on top, which gives off an intense blue glow. There is another door to the right. Again, Fen remains in the hallway. Averill stands not too far from her, but his mind remains elsewhere; he clutches his [[sending stone\|sending stone]]. <span class="spoiler">We are not okay ... 😬</span>

<span class="sticky blue">Obviously this room was made for one particular humanoid in mind 👀</span>

Moradin approaches the dais, humming confidently as he reaches out to the mirror despite Fen’s verbal warning. He disappears as he suddenly enters the Lucid Room. He finds himself in a similar room, 25 x 25 foot space, but the doors and dais are absent. He sees an exact copy of himself who then extends the blades from his sword shields. He fights himself as we await his potential return.

He eventually smashes his mirror duplicate and it crumbles. He returns to the room, somewhat battered, though the blue circle fizzles out. With no context, Twin states he always believed in him before going to the other door, which appears to be unlocked, though he attempts to use the key regardless. It doesn’t fit. 

Opening the door, the new space appears to be a natural cave system, contrasting with the carved structure of the spaces before. It’s a bit warmer and humid, as though we’re taking a breath outside. There’s a gentle golden glow. The hallway archs to the left, and whatever is beyond is out of view. Again, Ashissa checks on the ornate door. All the lights are out, but something needs to fill the central indentation.

The room opens to a larger cavern — 100 foot rounded space. There is grass on the ground and gently glowing golden trees with apple shaped fruit growing from its branches, despite the lack of sunlight. The trees block a direct line of sight to the other side. 🍎🐍

Corinne gracefully dances towards the trees, a gentle golden pollen falls. Her pupils dilate and she appears transfixed; she grabs the fruit and takes a bite. She offers us to take a bite and throws it to Moradin. Fen scolds him for a moment but he admits he only wants to inspect it. However, the pollen touches his skin, his pupils dilate, and he feels the compulsion. 

Suddenly they both believe that Volu isn’t such a bad guy, as though [[charmed\|charmed]]. Moradin begins to agree with his journal entry, stating, “the math is mathing. [ ... ] There may be multiple solutions, but there is only one *final* solution.” Rather than encounter/fight Volu, they rather return home and sit around. The rest of us take a mental note to stay away from the trees. 😳

Averill walks towards the center and casts [[daylight\|daylight]], brightening up the space as light emanates from [[Path in Purgatory/Items/Sun Shadow\|Sun Shadow]]. While Moradin and Corinne sit, contemplating on gathering more apples despite opposition from a few members, the rest of the group continue through the space. Some pollen falls on Fen and she picks an apple, though Averill is able to quickly swats it out of her hand. They retreat back into the Lucid Room together.

Twin and Ashissa continue forward finding a path that archs to the left, which opens up into another room. On a dais they find a metallic object with a bunch of strange shapes, and every second or so it violently shakes and changes into a different form. Ashissa successfully attempts to grab it with [[mage hand\|mage hand]] as it shifts forms and drops it into the [[bag of holding\|bag of holding]] Twin has ready. She makes a mental note to remember the [[portable hole\|portable hole]] at Sovarin’s place.

They make their way out of the room back to the Lucid (Mirror) room. Corinne and Moradin follow behind. We discuss for a bit on what do do with them, but cannot think of a solution in the moment that would last. With carefully crafted words, Twin and Averill convince Moradin he needs a Cardinal to add to his head collection. 🧟‍♂️ Though when his father is mentioned, he recalls Graz’zt said he would help him. We continue to double down on “guilt-tripping” him by mentioning Sendri and his mother.

We exit the Lucid Room and continue our conversation down the halls towards the ornate door. Ashissa points out that once someone gets hit, usually the charm fades. Averill offers and backhands Moradin’s face, while Ashissa attempts to hit him with [[Eldritch Blast\|Eldritch Blast]]. Offended, Moradin states that Volu wouldn’t do such a thing to his friends; however, Averill pointedly adds they are no longer friends, referring to the incident the night before. 🫢🫢🫢

Ashissa places the object into the door, and it opens as a purplish light emits from it. We enter a rectangular space about 50 x 70–80 feet with a raised half-circle platform at the opposite end. The room is better lit and there is a deep purple light emanating through as magical torches decorate the walls. The room is worse for wear; there are five standing pillars, though one has collapsed. Before the semicircle space, there is a stone constructed throne. On the semi circle, there is the stone constructed dais and above it is a gently pulsing orb of black energy — it is familiar to both Twin (his dream where he saw Divitae) — and Moradin (his dream where he encountered Graz’zt).

We feel an immense pressure of presence, greater than any divine presence we have ever felt before, emanating from the orb ... the Empty Orb. Sitting on the throne is Sovreign Luthais, staring out, eyes glazed over. Up on the semicircle, we see a figure laying on the ground front of the dais — it’s Inara, though it appears as all of the moisture was pulled out of her body.

“I gave it ... I gave it everything ... I gave *everything*.”

Averill looks at him with empathy as Luthais looks up to us and comes to the realization he was deceived. As we walk in, Luthais stands, takes a step forward labored. He takes another step, he attempts to speak, but then his head suddenly twists to the side, his arms fall. 

“No, no, no, my Volu — I think that you have done your part.”

<span class="floaterR">
	<img alt="Graz’zt, the Demon Prince" height="400" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/f0a37566f51d6cdb39d00ce6587b63be/62078dbae963a17a-c7/s640x960/febb078722b501a0c584c51a04f882f7be68e0ec.jpg">
	<p class="caption">Graz’zt, the Demon Prince</p>
</span>

Graz’zt possesses Luthais and his skin begins darkens; horns grow, as does an extra finger on each of his hands. Out of thin air, he grabs a massive notched sword, and pulls it in front. He rights himself. <span class="spoiler">The girls are a bit beside themselves in the presence of the <em>hot</em> demon prince.</span>

He expresses it took much longer than he would have liked and his dislike of the party. Moradin attempts to make friends, still under the effects and not clearly reading the room as he asks about his hand. It’s fine 🫣 Moradin expresses his disappointment, having wanted to converse with Volu in person. Averill, somewhat flabbergasted, asks if he didn’t expect this particular scenario.

Fen attempts to cast [[fireball\|fireball]], but Graz’zt’s eyes flash purple, and her magic fizzles out. We immediately enter into combat. 

Graz’zt charms Moradin and compels him to move closer to the dais. Ashissa sprouts draconic owl-like wings with her Form of Fate — there’s more than what meets the eye as she looks around the room.

Averill hits Graz’zt (natural 20 🥳).

Twin does some serious damage (natural 20 🥳), and upon realizing he’s surrounded, Graz’zt teleports behind Ashissa. Moradin moves away from the dais and casts bless, allowing Ashissa to attack (natural 20 🥳). He attempts to charm Ashissa, but she’s able to shake it off (DC 23). He immediately attempts it again, casting Dominate Person on her and advices her to kill her friends.

Fen attacks and moves away, but Graz’zt teleports after her and uses his lair actions. Corinne attempts to move away and he charms her to move closer to the dais. Her life essence pours out of her body.

Ashissa attempts to hit Twin, Averill and Myron but misses horribly.

Graz’zt attempts seduces Fen to kill us as well. Averill runs up and uses Solar Plexus and begins to wail on him (natural 20 🥳) — Ashissa is released from Graz’zt’s hold. Graz’zt attempts slashes him back with as much force.

Myron activates Twilight Sanctuary. Corinne moves away from the dais and hides.

Another natural 20 for Averill 🥳, as Moradin casts Healling Word, allowing him to strike Gra’zzt. He pulls at the orb and it radiates a pulse, dealing a large amount of necrotic damage on all of us. He then teleports behind Ashissa, he then compels Averill to attack his friends.

Ashissa attempts thunder step but he  casts counterspell. Averill then begins to attack Twin and Fen. Thankfully, he hits Twins duplicates and misses Fen (natural 20 🫠).

Myron comes towards Graz’zt to defend Ashissa (natural 20 🥳). Moradin successfully releases Averill from the Dominate Person, and moves closer to Graz’zt. He disappears for a moments and pulls at the stone, sending out another necrotic pulse.

<span class="sticky left">The amount of natural 20’s this session is insane. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽</span>

He goes to attack Averill, who uses the last of his resources to defeat him. As he grabs the geode, the purple energy dissipates. The orb lashes for a moment before it collapses in on itself.

Averill goes blind as his newfound ability deactivates.
