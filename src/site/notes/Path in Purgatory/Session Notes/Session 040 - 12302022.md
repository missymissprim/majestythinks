>Tensions run high as Corinne finds herself at odds with the aloof and distrusting Nameless Ones, who begin to recap and plan accordingly in regards to dealing with Luthais. Hoping we stalled his plans, we assign Moradin to scry on the Sovereign, and to our detriment, he has revived Inara. Fen and Corinne seek help from the recovering Sovarin and learn about the underground systems under Aden Vala. She gives Corinne a painting that reveals a clue to the entrance, however, Corinne takes it upon herself to examine the painting alone with her expertise, despite Fen and Averill trying to rationalize with her. After a few heartfelt conversations and apologizes, we solidify our plans and prepare for our inevitable encounter in Aden Vala.

>The Nameless Ones find themselves in the decaying city of Felindra after a narrow escape from Aden Vala, with Corinne and Sovarin in tow, and make their way towards the port for safety. With no immediate plan or destination, Twin begins his five day cat nap, while the rest of the party separates to have a few heartfelt conversations before succumbing to sleep. Moradin and Averill discuss the logistics and true meaning of friendship, and Ashissa and Myron discuss his brutal backstory, strengthening their bond. Corinne snoops and prods both the ship and the party to learn more about her situation, unfortunately angering Fen in the process, but finding a friend in Ashissa. While asleep, Twin receives a vision about Divitae and Theo, and Moradin confronts Graz’zt, receiving help from Sendri via Divine Intervention, who then comforts him with a visual of his father’s whereabouts.

</div></div>




Out in the ocean not too far from the coast of Felindra, morning comes as we continue to sail in circles, earning well deserved rest. Twin feels tired, but a bit better once losing a level of exhaustion (4th level). Averill goes up to the helm looking for Ashissa, who’s dead asleep, and briefly talks with Myron. They agree to spar after pointing out Myron’s new greatsword, considering Averill wanted to train and teach Ashissa to spar so she can protect herself. 

Corinne wakes and goes to check on Sovarin. She’s awake sitting criss cross applesauce, with a piece of parchment gingerly set out with an ink well and quill-style pen. She appears to be drawing a stylized scenery, reminiscent of Chinese ink wash painting (think *Mulan* title intro). It’s not her typical realistic style, it’s less detailed. It depicts Luthais and Inara, who appear rigid in contrast to the organic strokes. There’s anger behind her art. She doesn’t notice her pupil enter, who then closes the door and sits next to her. Corinne waits for her to finish, and Sovarin smiles at her intent. 

Sovarin appears very tired — she has come off a taxing experience, coming off her extreme high. She appears older than usual despite her youthful visage, weariness and tiredness around her eyes, as though the centuries are finally creeping along her features. Corrine continues to observe her and notices that her craft has not been affected by her experience.

Moradin loudly calls out that breakfast is ready, and her hand jerks. While not complete, she sets down her pen and regards Corinne. They talk about the group. Corinne finds the party unforthcoming with information and chaotic. She’s not too sure how to feel about us yet. 

Sovarin shares she is fearful for her people, and heartbroken. She’s not sure how her necklace broken, and explains it was a gift from Luthais and helped prevent her from falling under the affects of the fungus. While she sat in her office waiting for both the group and Corinne to return, she felt the amulet shatter and she was immediately overwhelmed. Corinne assumes it may have been the stone that Twin broke.  

She mentions Cadogan, who advocated for our group, informing her we were trustworthy despite our eccentric nature, mostly. She recognized us based off their previous conversations, and chose to trust his advice. Corinne continues to expresses her concerns, especially with the varying degrees of trust and friendliness that radiate from each individual. Her curiosity is piqued and she wants to know more about us. 

Sovarin asks Corinne how should she approach us based on her instincts, and Corinne admits her current persona may not be working — that a gentle more eccentric approach may be helpful in connecting with us. Sovarin senses a unique destiny with the group, but advices her to be as open as she feel she should be, but to be careful. Corrine asks if she should continue as she is, or in order to gain trust, show another side of her. Sovarin doesn’t give her an answer, allowing that to be her choice, and expresses that she has as much experience with our group as Corinne does at the moment.

Corinne goes off to find breakfast while Sovarin continues to rest. Averill invites Ashissa to spar, though after an unfortunate exchange of words suggests breakfast first, offering to bring Myron a plate. Twin continues to stay in the captain’s quarters feeling quite sluggish. Fen hangs out in her room before checking to see if everyone is heading toward the kitchen, following Averill and Ashissa as they pass by. 😂

Corinne enters the kitchen first and dances to keep distance from Moradin. 💃🏽 She expresses she has motion sickness and maintains movement to lessen the nausea. Moradin asks where she learned to dance, and she has picked up techniques from all over during her travels — not limited to dancing. Speaking of the arts and crafts, Moradin offers to teach her forgery. She asks if he does jewelry, and he mentions Fen’s necklace. She enjoys weapons, unique handcrafted weapons. ✨ Moradin lies saying he made everyone’s weapons, but Averill walks in and calls him out. 

Moradin describes breakfast (seared catfish with sea salt, oregano, and a honey glaze). Corinne asks if he can bake an apple pie and randomly pulls out *all* of the ingredients. Moradin proceeds to be gaslit.

Corinne goes to feed Sovarin once letting us know she’s okay, Averill prepares a plate for Myron and offers to walk Fen up to the deck as to not leave her with Moradin. Ashissa goes to feed Twin, but he comes to the kitchen and passes her. Fen and Averill tells her to go to Myron but she takes a bite, and gives her the plate he made for Myron. Averill admits he’s not the best wingman, but Moradin disagrees, reminding him of the brief time in the bar before the college party — apparently Moradin was already stupid drunk considering he doesn’t remember what happened. “He’s fun at parties.” 😐 Twin and Moradin reminisce about the party.

<span class="sticky" style="width: 280px">Averill has <u>never</u> acted and will <u>never</u> act as a wingman for Moradin for fear of enabling <u>the</u> walking red flag, etm. 🚩</span>

Averill hands Twin the [[Path in Purgatory/Items/Feather of the Archaeopteryx\|Feather of the Archaeopteryx]] back.

Myron talks to us telepathically to talk about our next steps. Fen sardonically points out he finally talked to her telepathically, and he offers to converse with her later to clear the air. Corinne asks Sovarin about evocation magic and runes, but informs her that it falls under wizardry studies, possibly referring her to Fen. Corinne goes up and Sovarin decides to stay in her room. Moradin makes a mental note to make tea (with dramamine) for Corinne to help her sleep and working on other stuff.

We all converge at the helm, and Corinne comes up on deck, and dances while checking on the runes. She has a grasp on how it works, but unfortunately is not trained to proficiently understand it’s application, etc. Averill invites her to join, but she needs to dance. Ashissa joins her — it’s a funny sight as she’s not as graceful as Corinne. Averill notices that Myron is trying not to laugh out loud despite doing the same. 

Myron asks how we are, and Corinne interrupts by asking what is our next plan. We inform Corinne about the (ritual) stone and do a slight recap, assuming we delayed Luthais, and Moradin shows that he is brand free. 👏🏽 Corrine begins to draw as we question Moradin, Twin moves around to be difficult. In response, she draws him with a pathetic face and deems him an attention seeker. Moradin then describes what he went through with Graz’zt (his hand hardened to stone and transformed into the same symbol that matched the stone) and how Sendri came to his aid. He informs us that he was given a vision of his father’s location. He then mentions the minotaur.

Averill then asks if the minotaur was missing a horn (the left horn). Moradin confirms and asks, which prompts Averill to pull said horn how with the Void Walker symbol engraved on it. Averill briefly recounts the time when the Gorin raiding party swarmed his hometown (Riverna). Having joined the military a few years prior, he fought with the minotaur who killed his mentor — without giving away too much he notes how his shadow came to be. 

Myron also speaks up on his experience with the Minotaur, informing us he killed everyone he knew. Corinne asks us questions to gain clarity in regards to the Void Walkers, and we describe our journey so far. She assumes we took it upon ourselves to be heroes, that we’re chosen, but we confess we just happened to get in their way before actively attempting to stop them — starting in Spenwald and so forth. We mention their plans in regards to the Empty One, devils, and demons; we reveal information about their hierarchy and that each has their own goals as to bring about an end and destroy the gods as they restructure the world.

<span class="sticky">We’re the Last Resort ... not the Chosen Ones 😅</span>

Fen mentions dying a couple of times, prompting Moradin to point out we need more diamonds. Myron interjects, saying he has one.

Corinne asks why were interested in Luthais. We inform her he kidnapped a few members of the party, leaving us with little choice in the matter. Wanting to connect the dots, she attempts to share some of her past observations of Luthais around midnight in consideration of the three-day deadline. We believe we caused a setback with our interference, hoping it buys us some time. Averill notes they seemed keen on having sacrificing the party to restore the stone, rather than do it themselves.

We discuss going back to confront Luthais with the deadline looming near (technically two days). We entertain that he may have restored the stone already, and that Gorin is not an option without Cadogan.

Corinne then interrupts and asks about the evocation runes. Fen recognizes the flame-based evocation style magic — most evocation releases magic (flame) towards a target, the runes anchor the magic towards a singular position — which harnesses the flame for propulsion. While we admit we didn’t explore the ship, we had a general idea of how/why, recalling the rumors we heard about the Pirate Gresado in Frenevid.

Corinne attempts to make friends with Fen again, but gets turned down. Averill points out friendships take time, but it falls on deaf ears. Moradin agrees with Corinne, getting closer to her, but she wants her space and dances away to pout. Returning to our conversation, Ashissa suggests we scry on Luthais. Twin steals her sketch book and puts it in Fen’s bag.

We continue talking about our adventure so far, what we know, have found, and where we want to go in regards to the gem hunt. Myron informs Corinne that the gems hold the consciousness of deities — and possibly demons/devils. We attempt to clarify that the stone Twin destroyed was not a god gem, despite the rest of us not seeing it. Fen points out the two gems we have, and Corinne asks about the necklace Moradin gave her, mistaking it for an engagement gift. Corinne goes for her book, notices it’s gone, and pulls out a different book. She looks and notices that Fen’s bag is somewhat ajar, and misshapen.

We talk about [[Resources/Spellbook/Scrying\|scrying]] before going back, and Fen needs materials, but remembers her spellbook and has a few diamonds on her from Illian, but keeps her thoughts to herself.  😂 Averil mentions looking into their possibilities (omen feature), and Ashissa offers to commune with Carilla. Corinne quietly observes Fen to learn more about her and her mannerisms. We go back and forth on who should scry and on who (Luthais or Inara ... you cannot scry on the dead).

Moradin scry’s on Luthais, and we disperse momentarily as he does so. Fen asks Corinne about the runes, but she asks for her book back. Fen is confused, and Corinne puts two and two together, though continues to suspect Fen. Fen looks in her bag and finds her book. Despite the situation, Fen checks her — she didn’t have to ask and could find the runes herself, she’s being nice by offering the mini-adventure. Fen suggests Twin possibly caused the shenanigans, who is now up in the crow’s nest. Corinne prepares to have a personal boundaries talk with Twin (lol good luck 🚩). The two ladies go to check on the runes. Ashissa harasses Moradin as he casts, and Averill pulls her away to spar.

The sky darkens, and a bolt of lightning strikes Moradin. His consciousness is carried over towards Aden Vala at lightning speed. He finds himself in a very dark space. There’s a smattering of small dimly lit candles, the floor is structured in stone, not happening in the tree. He sees Luthais, who is very still. His face is focused looking down at the body of Inara, limp and still, surrounded by the candles. He looks over and Moradin follows. He sees another figure who is wearing a cloak. She is wearing long dark robes and wears a mask formed out of a human skull. She steps forward and places a hand on Inara’s body. (Probably Immortuos based off Dornan’s description.)

At the edge of her hand, darkness pulls around, heavily congealed blood drips on Inara’s body. She pulls back and rights herself. “Just give it time.”

“I suppose I owe you one then.” He doesn’t turn to her. He steps forward and steps down, staring intensely. The dark coagulated blood begins to spread around Inara and soak into her skin, emphasizing her veins. Towards the end of the spell, she gasps for breath, but something seems off. (She may be undead.) Moradin’s consciousness returns.

Corinne leads Fen to the bottom of the ship to inspect the runes. There are different ways to construct magical sequences, runes, effects, etc.; the language is infernal in nature. It is activated by a code word, “Brisara” meaning forward which will intact the effect at the helm.

Averill first teaches Ashissa how to block, though she finds it hard to concentrate as Twin throws bird seed down at her from above. She’s able to catch the fighter “off guard” as he attempts to give instructions. He trips her to end the session.

We discuss Luthais’s whereabouts and how to find him, upset that he revived Inara. Fen and Twin offer to use their abilities to locate either the geode or Luthais. Corinne offers to visualize Moradin’s thoughts via [[detect thoughts\|detect thoughts]] and then [[encode thoughts\|encode thoughts]]. Unfortunately it’s Moradin … his surface thoughts ain’t it, does not pass the vibe check, and unfortunately we all see a sight we *never* wanted to see … Corinne unfortunately makes us suffer to join the experience. 😭 Fen offers to scry next time. The parts we *want* to see are then shown in stills, Immortuos and Inara’s revival. (Jacob accidentally admits that Immortuos was present. 😬)

Corinne attempts to identify the location perceived by Moradin, but with little success. It’s possibly this is underground, and Corinne doesn’t recognize it. Fen suggests we can return to Aden Vala and hope the elves aren’t a hive mind, though that’s wishful thinking. Corinne brings up Sovarin, who should have a substantial amount of information about Aden Vala and its infrastructure.

Corinne and Fen go to Sovarin’s room, Averill keeps Moradin on deck offering to strengthen their friendship, keeping him from interacting with the ladies unnecessarily. Corinne and Fen inform Sovarin of what’s going on. Sovarin is a bit distraught at the news, tears fall down her face. Corinne approaches her to comfort her. They convince her as it is of the utmost importance. 

Sovarin points out a pattern in the stones. When they first established the city, a portion of the continent was covered in flame and earthquakes as the elemental flames ravished the earth. The elves created bunkers underground for safety, they manage to survive for several years in those spaces. They continued to develop and grow underneath where Aden Vala now stands.

She’s not sure which room it is, but it is directly underneath the city. The girls ask how to identify the entrance and Sovarin pulls out her own sketchbook. It’s very old paper, she tears a sheet out …  🫢 pain comes across her face when she does and hands it to the girls. It is a painting of the city center square. Corinne observes the intent of the painting, but it’s worn. Sovarin guides her eyes and adjusts the picture. The leaves and trees adjust in the painting, at just the right angle, the leaves form a figure when looking at that angle. It looks like a jester doing a dance, but looking and pointing down. She tells them to look for this specific location to find the underground bunkers.

Unfortunately, Corinne takes it upon herself to study the painting alone, feeling as though her mentor is giving her a special assignment, and deliberately keeps Fen from observing the adjustment, in which Fen cannot make out specific details for clues. Corinne thanks Sovarin and offers to give her space for the rest of the day, though they’ll talk later. Sovarin thanks Fen and our group for saving her. Corinne goes to roll the paper, but Fen scolds her. She lays it flat in one of her sketch journals for safekeeping. Before they leave, Fen asks if Sovarin was friends with her parents. Sovarin likes to think they were. Fen informs her that they are happy where they are. Sovarin reflects that they made the right choice, and notes that Fen looks like her father, but Fen jokes about her nose resembling her mother’s.

They return to the deck and we get into an argument with Corinne about intentions and trustworthiness that especially upsets both Fen and Averill. Corinne defends her actions, glaring at Twin, stating that she needs to investigate it more, studying art under Sovarin and viewing this as an individual assignment, challenge and/or puzzle. A few members go through mental gymnastics upon hearing this. 😂 Averill argues that Sovarin didn’t hand it to her to examine alone nor is it an artistic challenge. Corinne continues to express her concerns with the group, feeling like an outsider, and complains about the lack of trust. She subtly brings up Twin’s crime against her without truly calling him out, but she’s pissed.

She asks us to respect her personal boundaries, but Averill calls out her hypocrisy, his boundaries being disrespected twice and counting from the previous day. Corinne admits she’s trying to get an idea of who we all are, especially because lies were mixed in with the truth — lies we didn’t take seriously. Averill attempts to give her a taste of reality, given that our lives (and others) are at stake. We’re not going to know one another well after one night, the party doesn’t even know each other well despite traveling for over two months together. Fen chimes in, agreeing that we don’t want her to be forthcoming about herself, but to be forthcoming about information about saving Aden Vala.

Corinne defends herself, though Fen points out she prevented her from observing the painting fully to catch on what Sovarin was showing her, though Corinne asks if she has an artistic eye and understands artistic interpretation, missing the entire point. She argues that we don’t understand her personality, and makes the discovery and investigation overly personal, not realizing she’s hindering us.

Fen leaves as Averill continues to explain to Corinne about the seriousness of the situation and urgency. He expresses that she doesn’t have to do everything alone, and that other perspectives could be beneficial to her. She doesn’t budge and Averill backs off. Ashissa, confused and not wanting to get in on the drama, asks if we’re going anywhere. Averill goes to help poor Myron, but Ashissa stops him saying it’s her *expertise*. Averill goes to his room to cool off and contact Zuri. Corinne immediately goes to Sovarin, angrily asking if Moradin started her apple pie, though Averill attempts to interfere with little success. 

<span class="sticky">We’re a group of friends who don’t trust one another 😬 </span>

Fen goes to find Twin and advices him to steal Corinne’s book on the off chance she never shows us so we can view the painting. She warns him that Corinne knows he misplaced her sketchbook, though he deflects. She then goes to Myron and Ashissa to let out her frustration. Twin joins and they begin to talk plans about going back to Aden Vala, and get the geode which is the half needed with Carilla’s Onyx. Fen expresses her concerns that if we sit around and allow Luthais to complete his plans, we may miss out on obtaining the geode ... or even lose Laf’Loran entirely with the corruption of the gem.

We’re not too far off shore, and have been going in circles all day. They decide collectively to go back and plan accordingly (Twin demands the group pull their own weight his time as though he’s being carrying the team this whole time 🙄), but Fen calls out Myron for not talking with her. She believes he’s mad at her, and he agrees to talk with her, though they receive a “playful” threat from Myron. Averill uses his sending stone to contact Zuri who is making her way back home. She asks him if he’s safe and okay, but he has to go to Ashissa, who gaslights him for a moment. Zuri threatens her, though Averill tells her not to take it too seriously. They establish they’re like siblings to one another, and that in itself is a comfort, especially to Ashissa who’s elder brother doesn’t care for her. Averill tells her he’s missing out.

Fen and Myron go to talk in “private” on the deck, and she expresses that he’s been distant with her since returning. He admits he feels guilty considering we have had a hard time staying alive after he left. He has had a hard time looking her in the eye, but Fen tells him his guilt is misplaced and she doesn’t hold his absence against him. She accidentally informs him about how Arcanis and Elliot relate to Ashissa’s backstory. Elliot had a hand in the experiments of the elixir of unlife, something Myron has some experience with and explains how it involved her people. She expresses how she couldn’t look Ashissa in the eye, relating to Myron’s struggle.

Myron points out that Fen has been on edge since his return. She admits there hasn’t been time to really process all that has happened — Elliot’s disappearance, hope that he’s alive, the overall journey, Elliot being a rabbit. She didn’t want to go to Aden Vala nor see that part of her heritage. She expresses that everything is happening to quickly and we’re missing too many details at this pace. It seems like we’re always several steps behind the Void Walkers. Myron expresses his concerns that she’s holding too much in, and she has the space express her self. They admit they don’t trust Corinne fully, but Myron understands her position having been thrust into a strange situation. He advices to give her time and grace.

Averill learns to man the helm from Ashissa, though it just looks like the dance moves from earlier. He admits he only knows formal dances, and Ashissa in turn admits she can’t. He offers to invite both Myron and her to formal events in the future when everything calms down. 

Moradin bakes the pie Corinne threatened him to make. We talk about our upcoming plans, though a few suggest a day of rest. Averill uses his omen, the details are hazy and gives him multiple potential endings. He gathers that if things continue on course, we have two more days as discussed. Each path ends with a confrontation with Luthais and stopping his actions. If we wait any longer ... there will be woe and destruction. We conclude Luthais will not leave Aden Vala, but there is no possibility of ending things peacefully.



We decide to scry around midnight and to rest a day. Averill mentions that they should talk with Corinne, additionally he wants to apologize. Fen agrees that we need to be transparent, but won’t join to apologize as they both got off on the wrong foot.

Corinne goes to Sovarin and complains. She admits can no longer do her persona — our group is not receiving it well — her energy changes as she removes her hat. She curls around Sovarin and hopes to be comforted. She calms down, grabs her hat and puts it back on. Sovarin advices her to try a different approach, but she doesn’t feel ready for that yet. Sovarin giving Corinne the painting reminds her of her father and he’s not here. She admits she got too defensive and wanted to prove herself. She pulls out the painting to decipher the clues.

Sovarin tells her she has been trained well and trusts that she’s be able to make it work, to keep her eyes on the main goal. She tells her that there are two perspectives that are necessary to keep in balance — neither is is more important than the other. If she finds herself stuck, looking too closely at the details, it wouldn’t hurt to accept another perspective. Corinne agrees and adds that she needs to put her pride aside to step back. Sovarin pulls out an old sketchbook and gives it to Corinne for her upcoming adventure. There is legacy and intent in every page of the book. She accepts the book in reverence and awe.

Sovarin admits there are a few drawings from before the Blight Year. She hopes she studies it so that it helps her with what she’s working towards. There is value in caution. Sovarin advices her not to tell everything and not to trust us entirely, but what we’re working towards is worth something. Corinne begins to study the painting of the town square, and gets the sense it will all make sense when she gets there.

She leaves Sovarin’s room and bumps into Averill, who genuinely apologizes for the earlier argument. She reveals that no matter how she deciphers the painting, we need to be there in person. She gets a bit vulnerable and teary, mentioning her relationship with her father, and Averill empathizes with her, mentioning his mentor. Averill openly tells her they have been as upfront and honest with her regarding the journey at hand, and unfortunately they know very little too, in an attempt to assure her. 

Corrine apologizes about invading his personal space. She also admits that she values her personal space and doesn’t like it invaded, she rather initiate. Averill warns her about interacting with Twin, expressing defeat while giving advice, but has a level of faith in his party members. He informs her of our immediate plans to dock in Felindra. She then dances around him and blows in his ear, throwing him off but leaving before he can say anything. He repeats a mantra to keep himself in check.

Moradin finishes the pies, but they have cinnamon, which makes Fen and Ashissa gag. He attempts to get chummy with Corinne and offers her “company.” She lets him know she has mixed feelings, though prefers his natural persona ... not the pervert and likes her boundaries. They reach an understanding, and he appreciates her stirring the pot. Unfortunately they talk too long, and she offers to help Moradin get with Fen. Averill eventually comes down and informs him the girls don’t do well with cinnamon. He offers to train with both Moradin and Corinne, who offers to help him incorporate dance while sword wielding. He does bring up the condition that she not touch him.

Later in the evening, near midnight, Fen and Moradin cast scrying. Fen’s eyes go white, and her vision slows, and she feels a presence with her. It speeds back to a jerk as her mind launches out of her physical body towards Aden Vala. She sees Volu who’s mostly stationary, looking around, tears falling down his face. On the ground, Inara’s breathing is labored. While she was unhinged before, there is a jerkiness to her physical form now. Her eyes dart and they’re glazed. Fen finds them on the balcony space, and the wine falling through, a bit more now. She sees the bodies of a large number of creatures, pixies, displacer beasts, various fey creatures dismembered, fresh and recent. The blood is oozing out making contact with the wine and mixing. The bowl rises with the center platform. 

Volu continues to weep. He takes out an elongated silver bowl, he scoops the mixture and feeds Inara, and goes on for a while and continues. He speeds up ... The raised platform lowers as he continues to drown her in the concoction, though Inara remains catatonic.

Moradin begins to see this as well. The pool eventually recedes and he sees Inara continuing to lay there. He looks up and a rift opens, similar to the one he invited us to enter. Out comes tumbling an elven figure, a young man wearing simple clothing, darker skin, light brown hair, and in his hand is a stone implement. Tears continue to stream down his face. He kisses his face, holds him for a minute, and thanks him. He takes the stone and places it on the dais. The wine begins to flow faster and faster. A dull greenish glow emanates from Inara and grows more intense. The air appears to shake and collapse.

“We’re so very close … only a bit longer, I promise.”
