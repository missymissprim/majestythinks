<span class="sticky">Averill, Fen and Moradin, and Twin have advantage. Sorry Ashissa! ♥️</span>

We (Ashissa, Averill and Twin) slowly make our way back with half our unconscious party (Fen, Moradin and Zuri). We find ourselves back at Sovarin’s abode. She’s in the kitchen making something that smells earthy and herby — stew apparently.

Averill places Zuri on one of the seats then helps get Moradin into a more comfortable position once Ashissa “drops” him. Sovarin attempts to lighten the mood, noticing we recovered our party. Twin pulls her leg saying we “unfortunately” lost a member (named Lori), who quickly becomes a “🎶 We don’t talk about Bruno 🎶” joke.

Groggy and not in tip-top shape, Fen begins to come to and observe her new surroundings — noting the organic nature of the room as though it were carved out from the tree. She notices the paintings, many scenic in nature of different art styles and others depicting the War of Gehenna, though different renditions of those she’s seen previously. Her sense of inhibition is not as strong as it should be as she is still reeling from the effects of her high.

Continuing to look around the room, she notices the rest of her party around her, though scoots away from Moradin. She immediately informs us that the Void Walkers are here, with Averill reminding her she was captured by them. She begins to describe her conscious moments, however it comes off as rambling. She claims Laf’Loran was around demons, but only when Luthais (the “fancy elf” as she put it) was present. She’s not sure — it could have been a trick of the eye/mind.

We begin to explain that we retrieved her and Moradin from said “fancy elf,” and Averill says hi after not seeing his wizard friend for a week. Fen asks if he’s really here, believing it’s a trick of the eye. Twin continues to (purposely) confuse Averill with Myron, freaking Fen out for a moment.

She begins to quickly disclose their adventures following his departure in response to “it’s been a week.” They defeated a dragon, a catfish, giant tree man, and an old woman in that time ... Fen believes she saw Elliot but as a rabbit (possibly a side effect of the Somnia flower). They threw poop in Moradin’s mouth and gaslit the poor dwarf. 💩🤢

She asks about Zuri, and Averill points out she’s still unconscious. <span class="spoiler">Averill begins to worry the longer she remains so.</span>

She introduces herself to Sovarin who joins our conversation. We begin to mention how Moradin is Sovarin’s biggest fan, leading to a conversation of how he came in possession of one of her paintings. We briefly describe our victory against Bishop Gresado. Fen also figured out how to make the boat (the Gilded Wind) fit into a pocket — super convenient. ✨ 

Ashissa asks for tea, which Sovarin goes to prepare, though Twin asks to distribute. *Certain* members of the party become very wary and warn the others.

Moradin soon begins to gain consciousness, however, feels a sharp pain in the back of his head, possibly from being dragged. Upon exclaiming his pain, Ashissa and Averill begin to make excuses about who carried who. 😂 Ashissa mentions *pregnancy,* and Averill, in his growing frustration, threatens to add her to his ongoing list. 🗒️

We begin to explain what happened at dinner with Luthais (refer to last session’s notes). We know he’s planning to send his people to another plane — Averill assumes the Feywild, though Twin argues possibly the Abyss in relation to other Void Walker activities (Frenevid and Dham Auram). Fen concludes he may be sacrificing his people, but we quickly correct her as Luthais believes he’s saving them from the impending doom.

We mention that in three days he will open a rift, sending his people to another plane, and that we’ve been invited to join and cross over along with anyone who can make the tight deadline. Twin jokingly asks, “What if we bring several cities ... ?” (We weren’t necessarily given a limit.) 

Ashissa clarifies that the Void Walkers want to get rid of us so that they can continue with their plans to return the continent (Adrilos) to the Empty One. 🦅🪨🦉 

Fen begins to hear the muffled sounds of reverly outside, and we mentioned that Luthais has them drugged, as it’s all a part of his plan. Upon mentioning drugs, Twin reveals he has a bag of them (8 vials of grafita dew), which he stole from Darran. Moradin immediately takes a shot of the questionable substance (possible DC CON 16+, a clear liquid with a colorful sheen) hoping to cure his headache. He then feels off kilter (in a nice way 😅), his inhibitions are lowered, and he feels a sense of euphoria. But it doesn’t feel any different to him — as if it were a normal Tuesday. 🤦🏽‍♀️

Moradin begins to express his affection for Twin, who stealths away from the drugged mountain dwarf.

Fen begins to question why she and Moradin were kidnapped, and we reveal that Luthais wanted to talk to us (the remaining three). She emphasizes her question sarcastically as we all know that conversing with the ✨ Chaos Crew ✨ was not the best option for a serious conversation. 😬 <span class="spoiler">And he made it worse by kidnapping Zuri 🗡️🗡️🗡️</span>

Considering the tension, Fen asks if Luthais still had his fingers. Averill admits that their safety was top priority, and in the end it was Ashissa who needed to be calmed during the ordeal. Fen asks if he spoke common, which he did, but to be safe the group relied on Averill’s elvish to maneuver through the city and shop. 

Upon this revelation, Fen pointedly states, “You went shopping ... while we were kidnapped.” 😅 We reveal we couldn’t show up to dinner early as Luthais is quite orderly, to the point of obsession, in a disturbing way. We also mention he is in possession of Laf’Loran’s Geode and that it allows him to connect to Graz’zt. Fen attempts to connect what she saw in regards to Laf’Loran associating with demons.

Moradin suddenly states he’s hungry during this conversation, to which Averill sardonically asks if he has any pocket bacon. Moradin then remembers the catfish and begins to fry some on his shield. Averill unfortunately learns strange things about his fellow party members as Ashissa now has a fridge for her eggs and the remaining catfish not in the bag of holding. 

Flabbergasted, Averill again mentions it was only a week, to which Ashissa announces they can now feed for a month. Moradin finally notices that Averill is back, though almost burns him as he goes to hug him. Poor Sovarin asks us not to make a mess of her house as she continues back and forth in the kitchen, slowly realizing how much of a rambunctious group we are.

Moradin then notices Sovarin. Fen attempts to warn Sovarin about Moradin and his “conquests,” hoping to spare her from being his next fling. Moradin learns she is the painter/artist he has been admiring for some time. 

Ashissa joins Fen in warning Sovarin about Moradin’s “charms” and asks about her cooking. The stew is an earthy blend of spices, to which she notes is beautifully balanced.

Twin asks Sovarin if any of the information we have revealed seems familiar to her. Averill notes that she referred him “Volu” earlier in the day—he now uses the term of endearment as a pseudonym. 😒 Fen nearly blows up on her once hearing this, questioning whether or not she knows about the Void Walker’s intentions. At the same time, we quickly catch up Moradin with the details of the dinner—he’s still confused about Averill’s return. <span class="spoiler">Twin attempts to remind him about his “intense staring contest” with Averill in the tub, again mistaking Averill for Myron, especially since Averill bathes alone. Averill continually points out that he and Myron look nothing alike. Though it can be said that Myron and Averill are alike in demeanor, but opposite visually.</span>

We come back to officially introducing Moradin to Sovarin, and Fen informs him of her warning. He doesn’t take it well. 😂 But Fen thinks she’s nice.

Again, Fen asks about Zuri ... Averill begins to worry (more) the longer she remains unconscious. He begins to mention the fungus and how it affects anyone of elven descent.

The chaos (revelry) outside concerns Fen, as there are elves in various states of dress and drunken/drugged stupor. There is an eerie cadence to the dancing as if a master puppeteer is pulling strings. She is somewhat perturbed by the current state of Aden Vala as it is not anywhere close to the image her parent’s spoke of. It’s a possible mixture of the effects of the fungus  and Luthais meddling.

Moradin begins to ask Sovarin about her paintings, specifically the War of Gehenna. Apparently, Sovarin is exactly 1,237 years old. Moradin is a little put off by this, “whispering” to Twin about his preferences. An uninhibited Moradin is not a quiet Moradin. 😅

We continue to discuss the details of the tense dinner with Luthais, making assumptions about his plans and connecting it to other Void Walker occurrences. Twin points out that we went to the dinner to not only “rescue” our kidnapped friends, but to scope out Luthasis for Sovarin. She tells Fen that she’s grown suspicious of him for some time, and wanted to know his intentions and goals. Fen begins to lay down *facts* about the Void Walkers and anyone affiliated with them—no one we met so far has been “good.”

Sovarin has a hard time seeing her friend in a bad light, especially considering his intentions. Moradin points out that Luthais may believe his intentions are good. Though, it can be argued that Luthais is misguided by his own convictions and self-righteousness.

Sovarin asks about the Empty One, and Twin recounts what we were told (refer to last session’s notes for more details): According to Lutahis, the Empty one once ruled Adrilos, however, it was stolen from him by the Ascendant (the gods). However, under the Ascendant, the world is coming to an end. The Void Walkers, individually, have come up with plans to stop this — hinting that they are not on one accord.

We then recount Luthais’ plan to send his people to another plane, while he stays behind to “see the end through.” Fen does not like the sound of this. It’s super sketch.

We inform Sovarin that the other Void Walker cardinals have resorted to genocide by opening void gates to speed up the process. Averill recalls from their first encounter with Gresado in Frenevid that the void gates need sacrifices to stay open.

Moradin then asks Sovarin about the void gates and their mechanisms. According to Sovarin, the void gates sound similar to a technology made by Baraban. The gods were losing the war until the gates were developed. It’s possible, the Void Walkers are using this same technology to enact their plans, considering they were ancient and needed to be reawakened. Moradin shows her the battery he obtained from the machine in Frenevid, however, she wasn’t familiar with the construction of said devices.

<span class="sticky left">Each cardinal has a bishop. Bishop Sania is under Volu. ... Was Revnon under Arcanis or Immortuos?</span>

At the mention of bishops and cardinals, Fen notes that Sovarin appears clueless about the Void Walker hierarchy.

Attempting to glean more information, Averill asks Sovarin about the The Blight Year. It was a miracle that anyone survived. The presence of the gods were gone — as they had left the world. The world was falling apart under the guidance of certain individuals. Pockets of life have survived and the world has been rebuilding since. A lot of history, especially of the time before, was lost.

The conversation shifts to dealing with Luthais, to which Averill admits to wanting to kill him. <span class="spoiler">While he does apologize to Sovarin for his bluntness, this solution is a bit extreme, even for Averill. 🤔</span> Sovarin understands we need to take Luthais out (or rather subdue) based on the information we gave her in regards the dinner conversation. Moradin promises Sovarin he will not deal the final blow, hoping to glean more from Luthais, and possibly emphasize with him. <span class="spoiler">Averill did try to “craftily” do this during the dinner, but only succeeded in angering Luthais. Granted, he was totally over the ✨ Chaos Crew ✨ and their <em>immaturity</em>.</span> He’s definitely misguided, but he may be doing more harm than good. However, no one can deny his love for his people and the lengths he would go to save them. 😞

Fen and Twin begin to ask about the ritual Luthais would need to perform to open the gate. May be there’s a room ... 👀👀👀

Ashissa expresses her frustrations with Luthais’ condescension as he continuously lorded his age over us. Fen sympathizes and points she’s an infant compared to Luthais. Curious, Sovarin asks about Fen’s origins and reveals she was close friends with Fen’s parents (Elandris). Her parents were once close with Luthais, however, they didn’t agree to the shift of worship from Gaelira to Laf’Loran. They particularly didn’t love talking about their time in Aden Vala nor the Blight Year, and Fen was quite indifferent.

Moradin mentions his family name (Thraudmere), hoping to impress Sovarin or measure his family’s reputation outside of Dham Auram. He lucks out and attempts to had her a business card, but nice try. <span class="spoiler">Free visit, but no discount on the merchandise apparently.</span>

Fen wonders if Laf’Loran is unaware and involved due to the gem, becoming corrupted due to Graz’zt’s influence. Twin suggests we steal the geode and see if it is corrupted, which prompts Ashissa to question whether any of the gems we have come in contact with have been influenced by an individual fiendish presence. She assumes they are linking with the gems — Orcus linked to Carilla’s Onyx; Graz’zt to Laf’Loran’s Geode, etc — and that the gods do not have power how the gem is used or accessed. They may be batteries and the demons are using their powers for their own purposes. 🤔

Fen then mentions the fungus and how its properties are different than say a fun prank, a trait associated with Laf’Loran. Averill asks Sovarin when Luthais obtained the geode. Apparently, he found the geode after the Blight Year, and the fungus began to develop around that time. It’s possible that the power from the geode has been slowly leeched away, and now the corruption has taken hold and increased the abnormality of it all.

<span class="spoiler">Moradin states he missed Averill who admits he missed Moradin (and his shenanigans) while burning alive. Ashissa points out that he’s “burnt”. Fen also points it out, though was unsure how to address it at first. He claims he has not stories to tell, but Ashissa rats him out. 🙄</span>

Sovarin admits that she’s concerned about fiends being associated with the gods. The fiends (devils) disappeared with the gods. They may be trying to weaken the boundary and entering our plane through the void gates. They are strangely working with the demons — which is troubling and *unusual*. In the past, the war was only between the devils and the gods.

<span class="spoiler">Averill mentions that the Void Walkers know a lot of personal information about each member of the group. It’s a surprise to no one, but for Averill it’s a concern for various reasons as he felt he was quite under the radar.</span>

Moradin mentions his father and his involvement with the Void Walkers. They may be using his abilities to reopen the gates. Conversation somewhat shifts to Divitae, asking Sovarin if she’s seen a particular dwarf around Luthais.

Every night, Luthais retires to a particular room in the palace. He may be preparing to open the rift and needs a space large enough to transport his people. Averill mentions that he may sacrifice his steward (Inara the Fairy) — pure speculation — in relation to the experiments in Felindra. Fen then deduces that Luthais may be sacrificing his people under the pretense of saving them.

Before the Blight Year the elves were nomads, freely wandering. Luthais brought the remaining survivors together and united the elves during the aftermath. Sovarin believes it would go against his beliefs and allegiance to his people to willingly sacrifice them on the word of fiends. During the dinner, “Chaos Crew” attempted to hint that it could all be trap, but Luthais wasn’t having it. It’s obvious he’s been manipulated for years.

Moradin asks Sovarin who would be able to hold Luthais accountable for his actions and judge him accordingly should we subdue him. Unfortunately being the Sovereign leaves very few to no options as it would be treason. As we talk about how to deal with Luthais (kill, incapacitate, restrain, etc.) — as a few members have colorfully and openly mentioned killing and harming him for various (✨personal✨) reasons — Sovarin asks if we have courses of action that include not killing him. Fen argues we should expose him, but Ashissa mentions how limited our options are in this particular situation. Moradin quickly adds that we need to set our priorities straight. <span class="spoiler">OMG the smartest thing he’s ever said 😭</span>

As we continue the conversation, Sovarin eventually moves to her balcony. Twin follows, keeping his distance, though sees she’s panicking as a few of us have mentioned permanently taking him out with little to no remorse. <span class="spoiler">Sorry not sorry, girl 😓 some of us are in our feels. Granted Averill is venting to release some of his “justified” anger, especially as Zuri continues to remain unconscious.</span> We argue about this particular point for some time, until Fen plainly mentions we’ve never successfully defeated a cardinal. Averill agrees the party may be out of their element.

We continue making a plan, with Moradin getting us back on managing and solidifying our priorities. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 He suggests we stop the possible destruction of the city and its people, and if we accomplish that, without outright killing Luthais, subdue him. If we can’t subdue him, Moradin claims his head (to add to his growing collection ... 🤢), though Averill notes that even before the encounter they need to get the geode off his person.

We decide our priorities are mainly to:
1. stop Luthais’ plan to open the gate;
2. get Laf’Loran’s Geode away from his person;
3. and incapacitate Luthais (not kill 😒).

Fen continues to think about the details and wonders if we need to create a distraction so Twin can stealth through the castle, to which Ashissa iconically states, “What’s more distracting than our presence?” 😂 We do mention that Luthais has nearly the whole city under his control in an uncanny sort of way, like a puppeteer. It could be a hive mind situation as they were all *too* in sync. The girls decide it would be best if the rest of us remained quiet while Twin conducts some reconnaissance.

We admit that Chaos Crew has only been in the city for a few hours and that we’re most likely not safe. We only decided to make base at Sovarin’s at her suggestion for our protection as a majority of the group are not elves.

With a plan in mind, Fen attempts to tell time, but is still somewhat under the influence. Twin then tests Fen’s skills as her keen mind isn’t at full capacity, (craftly) getting her to identify the deck of cards Zossa gifted him.

Averill checks on Zuri, who is unfortunately still out 😭 (Jacob what did you do?!). Ashissa continues to *try* Averill mentioning the dreaded hypothetical pregnancy. Thankfully, for her sake, the conversation quickly turns to the Sky Pillar where he trained for a week under brutal conditions.

Fen identifies the deck of illusions and notes that it could be used as a wonderful distraction as we snoop around the palace. Moradin begins to question where the cards came from and Ashissa lies saying Averill still has a bunch of money, but he tells the truth instead despite not knowing where the cards came from. She attempts to persuade him to join her lie and he refuses ... *if only she wasn’t almost on the list*. He continues saying he’s only been back a few hours, and then she lies again saying they were swiped from some poor soul in the city.

<span class="sticky">Cue conversation about Dora costumes and concerning costumes in general 😂</span>

We then discuss several options and possible goals for the stealth mission:
1. figure out where the ritual is happening
2. if possible, swipe the gem
3. gather more information to figure out what is going on

<span class="spoiler">Moradin notices that Ashissa is wearing a nice headband to which she claims she made—a woven, golden band.</span>

Sovarin has rejoined us at this time—not sure when, but she does. Twin admits that he may need time before Luthais retires (at about midnight) to explore, and suggests that we all go to the palace as a group — less suspicious that way and provides needed backup if things go awry. Sovarin proposes we enter the palace with her which should be no problem since we recently had a dinner with him, no one would question her entrance since she has quarters there.

Ashissa reveals to Sorvarin that she is a Yuan-ti (after lying about laying eggs once Sovarin asked her to lie 😂) as we get into the topic of possible disguises (e.g. generic elf) for Twin to safely scout and investigate. Sovarin shares that Yuan-ti were the products of an attempt to fight back during the war. Her people weren’t regarded as people. 😞 They were the results of  experiments on one of the servants of Asmodeus, Karaz’khil — he was quite troublesome considering he seemed to be on par with the dukes and princes of the Nine Hells. Ashissa is “somewhat” comforted, but appreciative about learning more about her people’s origins.

Fen mentions a spell she has that could help us gather more information within the last 24 hours. Once Twin identifies which room Luthais may be conducting the ritual(s), she can cast this spell to learn more about the ritual itself.

<span class="spoiler">Twin and Moradin swap some inventory.</span>

Myron contacts Ashissa via sending having made it to Aden Vala — he’s concerned about his surroundings. She tells him to follow Zuzu (pigmy owl) who she sends out to fetch him. 😏

Moradin asks about the Somnia flower which is imbued with the magic of Laf’Loran. It is a sleep inducing remedy — whether it’s strengthening the mind to have dreams or lessening boundaries between such spaces it’s uncertain. However, it greatly affects the elves. Unless elves do so willingly, very few things put them to sleep, like Laf’Loran’s magic. Averill quickly points out a red flag, unfortunately knowing Moradin too well. 🚩🚩🚩

Ashissa attempts to wake Zuri with sneezing dust but Averill (purposely) gets in the way and almost suffocates. <span class="spoiler">Better him than her.</span> He uses Lay on Hands and relieves Zuri of her pain. She wakes, glad to see Averill, but then Ashissa chimes in. 😒 Averill hands her a sending stone, paired to his own — she seems to like the idea of the direct connection (no offense Ashissa ♥️). 

<span class="sticky">Ashissa is walking on a thin line with Averill. 🤣</span>

Ashissa who tells Averill to grow a sense of humor and continues to harass the poor couple. He expresses some frustration toward her for her antics, comparing her to his sisters, though admits she’s not as bad as Darina. Even Zuri chimes in on how bad Darina is — may even be argued that she’s almost as bad as Divitae. It’s hard to say if Averill is joking, poking fun of the eldest Kane daughter, but Fen scoffs at the idea that anyone is worse than Divitae.

Despite the silliness, Averill asks Zuri what happened. She was in search of inspiration, found herself in Aden Vala, though not as welcomed as she thought, and then it all went black. Zuri and Fen get on the topic of how weird Aden Vala has been and somehow talk about taking drugs. Averill is somewhat flabbergasted, even Ashissa joins reminding everyone they’re about to conduct a heist. <span class="spoiler">Zuri looks at him, “Do you not want me to take it?” To which Averill admits he would never stop her, but as a lawman and some personal history, he‘s a little concerned.</span>

Upon hearing the word naked and feeling the euphoric effects of his high, Moradin strips outside the front door, possibly to join the revelry. Sovarin even tells him not to do so on her balcony. He makes a poor attempt to convince Averill to join. Instead, Averill catches up with Zuri and tells her about their upcoming plans. He reveals little of what happened to him as to not worry her.

Zuzu returns and perches on Ashissa’s shoulder. Myron approaches, disguised as an elf (to better fit in his surroundings), tall in stature ... and unfortunately gets a full view of Moradin’s birthday suit yet again. Moradin goes for a bear hug, happy to see his friend, and Myron greets him. As Moradin goes to join the celebration, Myron goes inside Sovarin’s abode to greet Ashissa and others.

He greets all of us but then speaks and we hear his voice for the first time. 😳😦 Averill purposely trips Ashissa for revenge (nat 20 😈) and she falls into Myron’s embrace, bumping face first into his armor. <span class="spoiler">You’re welcome ... bro 😘</span> He’s a bit surprised to see her in her natural state.

Fen notes that it’s strange to hear his voice not in her head. It’s a new development and he’s still trying to get used to it—possibly due to healing trauma. Twin continues to confuse Averill and Myron ... <span class="spoiler">How my guy ... how? Or rather, why? 🥲 </span> and clocks that Fen is still somewhat off. 

Cue montage: we catch Myron up on our travels and upcoming plans. As this happens, Moradin is slowly becoming the life of the party. Fen refuses to leave the tree house until he clothes himself, prompting Ashissa to intimidate the dwarf with her stern tone from a distance. He pays her no mind, nor Fen who gives him an ultimatum. Myron offers him his special reserve of alcohol from Gorin, and he happily gets ready. <span class="spoiler">At least we know Moradin likes something more than Fen 😂</span>

Zuri decides to sit out, still feeling strange wanting rest, and makes Averill promise to care of himself. Not one to argue, he promises to return to her. <span class="spoiler">She pulls him in for deep kiss and the action forces the others to leave the room.</span> He then proceeds to tells her to get out of the city and go somewhere safe, preparing for the worst should things not go according to plan. The promise is mentioned again.



Ashissa gives Moradin the headband of intellect her brother made for him, and Twin stealthily places the emerald pen in Fen’s belongings.

Once getting ourselves together, Sovarin leads us to the lift to the Arbora Regala. We’re greeted once again by the dancers and orchestra. Many are enjoying their choice of drink and/or drug(s). Their clothing (if they’re wearing any at all) is more refined than the denizens down below. She guides us through the mass of individuals.

Fen begins to feel the effects of the lack of inhibition fading. It was trying to clamp down on her as she entered the space causing her to immediately shake the feeling. The effects of the drugs are receding on both Fen and Moradin. <span class="spoiler">... Moradin is just drunk on life.</span>

Before Twin slips away, Moradin casts [[enhance ability\|enhance ability]] (Wisdom checks) on him and Ashissa establishes her link.

We follow Sovarin to her office space through a series of corridors. It’s a combination of a small study and art studio. Similar to the dining room, the table is built from the tree.

She asks Twin what he’s planning. (It’s about 10 pm.) He asks her about the layout of the palace and where Luthais would frequent. She quickly draws the structure/layout of the palace and hands it to him. Moradin recreates the map with an enchanted pebble.

Twin hands Averill the [[Path in Purgatory/Items/Feather of the Archaeopteryx\|Feather of the Archaeopteryx]] in case things go sideways and we need a way to get out — by midnight it should be recharged. 🥹🤞🏽 He begins to sneak through the castle to find Luthais’ ritual space as Ashissa mind links with him to establish communication.

Fen asks if Luthais informed any of his people about his plans, and is met with an unfortunate no. He hasn’t even told Sovarin who he happens to be close with. With his people drugged, they’re much more complacent to do as he says, no questions asked. She begins to wonder about the effects of the fungus and hypothesizes that the fungus and drugs are related — the drugs may be made from the fungus. Or the drugs heighten and accelerate the effects of the fungus.

Twin locates Luthais’ personal chambers and sees a few armed guards with him as he sits at his desk in writing in some book. He continues and finds the ritual chamber — a large, inconspicuous,  organic doorway that possibly leads outside — not too far from Luthais’ chambers. He notices a runic script outline the doorway, something magical in place. Twin attempts to describe the symbols to Ashissa (nat 20 🙌🏽) who relays them to Fen.

It is an enchanted magical barrier that is evocation in nature. There is a sequence of code necessary to open the door lest it is destroyed or damaged somehow with the incorrect code. Twin attempts to find a balcony space, but it’s a bit further down the hallway. (With some decent climbing, he could possibly get to the other side of the ritual chamber.)

He climbs towards a supported balcony that’s rounded out and blocked by the curve of the tree. There is a lot of natural decoration along the railways. Inside it appears to be a ritual or meditative space. A shallow bowls leads to a dais at the center, upon which a stone sculpture appears similar in form to the 6-finger symbol (Graz’zt) that were on the documents in Felindra. (Same symbol on Moradin’s skin, it just popped up a few days ago ... *my brother in Christ* 🤦🏽‍♀️ Myron is the only one who has seen it so far.) 

<span class="sticky">Averill doesn’t know about the mark on Moradin. 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️</span>

Twin climbs in and it feels like he stepped into a shallow layer of water, he believes its blood at first, but it’s a thin sheen of wine moving from the top of the structure towards the dais, and falling to who knows here. He sees the stone symbol at the center that begins to hum. It begins to radiate a purplish magical energy as he takes a few vials of wine.

Moradin begins to feel the marking on his body burn. He feels there’s a presence with/near him. In the back of his mind he hears, “Don’t forget your father. Don’t forget the deal that we made, I can return him safely to you.” He (possibly Graz’zt) doesn’t want Moradin to speak about the deal to the rest of the party.

Moradin asks how long the drugs will be in effect. Averill offers the Purified Evertide Water but Moradin rejects it upon the voice telling him not to take it. “It’ll hurt you.” Moradin asks the voice what does he need to do. It tells him to help Volu complete his plans. He mulls it over in his mind. 😱

Twin continues to search the room. He asks the group (mind link with Ashissa) if he should take the stone. Fen and Ashissa argue that we don’t know what’s going on and that it could be more dangerous to take it now, though Moradin thinks we should take it now due to convenience rather than later. He drops a ball bearing down the hole the wine is going and no sound comes.

Twin inspects the doorway to see if it’s possible to open it from the inside, but unfortunately it still requires a password. 🥲 Recounting his steps, he notes that while it wasn’t guarded, no one really frequented the area — Luthais may be the only one who walks this particular hallway to enter said chamber. He and Fen exchange ideas (via Ashissa) on how to get through the door so she can enter and cast a spell to learn about what happened in the room within the last 24 hours. Unfortunately, she needs to be inside the room. Moradin jumps in as well as they figure out how to go about obtaining the password(s). However, She argues that knowing the ritual is more important than the password.

Ashissa announces her mind link is almost up.

Twin sees a smaller outdoor space above where he’s standing. He climbs up to get a better view.
He sees a child’s chair and small piles of books sitting on the ground. 😨

Twin quietly opens the door to enter into the hallways of the palace. It’s dark inside, a dimly lit sparsely decorated yet large space. He senses eyes on him and his rapier glows a bit. He hears an eerie, childlike voice, “What brings you here?” 😱 **NOPE**

He quickly makes his way back to the balcony and climbs away, he sees the creature fly out the room coming after him. It’s Inara. 🧚🏽‍♀️ She asks why Twin is in this particular space. She claims to be a little girl — Luthais treats everyone as children due to his age. 🙄 Twin informs Ashissa that “we’re busted” as he prepares to fight the unhinged fairy. Unfortunately, the rest of the party cannot do anything at the moment, unsure of where Twin is located (the ritual chamber). Ashissa sends out Zuzu to locate Twin.

<span class="sticky purple left">🎶 Cue creepy children’s music 🎶<br><br>~ yours truly suggested the idea 😏</span>

Inara eventually stuns Twin (legendary action 😰) with a booming guttural voice, which Averill barely makes out and uses the opportunity to use Lay on Hands on Moradin — the presence doesn’t leave but he is no longer under the effects of the drug. 

Unfortunately Ashissa’s mind link has ended, and has not heard from Zuzu. Sensing danger, the party decides to find Twin. Twin is pulled towards the center of the dais.

He feels the stun release, but then she uses another legendary action. 😓 They continue fighting, the orb is gone (possibly referring to his duplicates?) and Twin is near the stone. He grabs the stone, goes to attack it while jumping off the balcony, pumping *everything* he can into it (rule of cool 😎). (Moradin rolled a nat 20 for a Wisdom saving throw at this time. 👏🏽)

Twin cleaves through the stone and it disintegrates — Moradin’s mark burns even more. Fen sees Twin fall and casts [[Feather Fall\|Feather Fall]]. Inara clocks Fen who instantly recognizes her as the one who kidnapped her; she gives Fen a smile. <span class="spoiler">Discussions of adding Destiny Die mechanics to the gameplay/narrative 👀</span>

Inara attacks Twin and he goes unconscious. 😦😱😭 She grabs him by the collar and flies away with him, leaving the rest of the party stunned and helpless.

The presence in Moradin’s mind is now darker and angrier — “That was not part of the plan.”



#todo/purgatory 
- [x] Cast [[Hunter’s Mark\|Hunter’s Mark]] on Inara and retrieve Twin, hopefully alive.
- [x] Discover and release Moradin from Graz’zt’s influence.
