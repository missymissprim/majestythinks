<span class="spoiler">Everyone gets advantage tonight for our two year anniversary. 🥳 Zerai is also joining us ... and our perpetual chaos.</span>

We’re looking out an organically constructed window in Arbora Regala, the palace and a centered-out, massive hollow tree in Aden Vala. We see Twin falling down after atomizing a stone with a symbol that’s recognizable to the group (the symbol of Graz’zt). Fen saves him with a [[Feather Fall\|Feather Fall]], however, this allows Inara the fairy to catch up with him. She strikes him and he goes unconscious in the air. She grabs his collar, and pulls him up about to fly away (~35 ft away from the group).

Some of the party attempts to cast spells in response to save Twin, but a black orb appears, and Inara and Twin are gone. Not good ... 😅 Myron informs us (out loud) that he’s going to try something. He closes his eyes and his crescent moon amulet glows.

Twin finds his consciousness drifting somewhere vaguely outside his body, hovering about 15 ft above it and Inara back in the ritual space. Beyond the 15-foot radius everything is hazy. He believes he sees another figure standing in the distance, somewhat unclear as though viewing through a [[Scrying\|Scrying]] spell.

Next to him he sees a hovering form that he’s seen once before — A tan skinned elvish man wearing green and purple jester-like robes (Laf’Loran). He’s lazily laying down as if lounging on a chaise, reclining a bit, very chill. They chat a bit about doors and whatnot, referring to our last interaction with the trickster god, to which doors appear momentarily. Twin takes stock of his form … his soul, a semi-translucent form in space. 

“Well that’s interesting,” Laf’Loran points out, staring off into the distance somewhere, and not cluing in Twin who asks what in resposne.

Back in the hallway, we watch Myron’s necklace glow more intensely. One of his eyes glows purple, and the other green. His face pains … 😥

Laf’Loran informs Twin they’re about to have some fun. At the snap of Laf’Loran’s fingers, Twin’s consciousness is then lurched and thrown about elsewhere. Suddenly, he sees the group from a lower vantage point than he’s used to. However, as he looks down, there‘s no fur on his arms … he’s in Myron’s body. 😳 We’re all a bit dumbfounded, while Ashissa is distraught.

“If a rabbit can do it, why not Twin?”

Myron speaks in his own head to Twin, it’s weird as they share a body, though Myron doesn’t have much control, even as Twin shushes him to be quiet (lol). As we try make sense of this conundrum, Myron informs the Moradin and Ashissa via telepathy that he’s around. Fen gets upset for being left out, wishing to confirm the whereabouts of her friend. Twin shifts the conversation to “more important things” and informs us about what happened in regards to the fight Inara and what instigated it. 

Moradin’s symbol burns and the voice (Graz’zt) informs him to help Inara and restore what was broken, referring to the stone. “... and there’s still hope for you.” 

Fen asks Twin where we can find his body — one floor above in the ritual chamber.

Averill overhears Moradin quietly say “Okay” having responded to Graz’zt. He lies and says he was responding to Myron/Twin. Averill finds this weird and expresses his concern.

Fen freaks a bit more and Moradin informs us that he has bad news. As he begins to strip, most of us respond in horror asking him not to. Twin states that he chose Myron’s body for a reason, further implying he’s better than a rabbit — to which Averill then learns/revists that Elliot’s consciousness was briefly in a rabbit. Moradin reveals his brand (a six-pronged symbol), pulling back his armor.

Graz’zt sternly tells Moradin to tread very carefully.

Averill uses Divine Sense in response. He clocks the blinding celestial and dark fiendish presence from the individual amulets (Carilla’s Onyx and Galeria’s Emerald) and a hint fiendish presence coming off from Moradin. <span class="spoiler">Moradin did do a legend lore on the symbol when he first got it.</span> The party begins to question him with various levels of concern, anxiety and irritation — maybe some hurt that he didn’t feel he could tell *anyone* in the group 😞. Fen assumes based off Moradin’s response that he possibly slept with a demon and Graz’zt offers to arrange that for him if he so wished, continually buttering up the cleric.

Moradin begins to tell us how it happened — probably in the first after the bird pooped in his mouth (not a Elliot-rabbit lol, major gaslighting happening here). He then lets us know that Graz’zt has been giving him suggestions to do things and in return he can get his father back. Averill (definitely upset in the sad kind of way) asks why Moradin didn’t say anything. Moradin had hoped it would eventually go away. Fen calls him out and then asks if anyone else has one, to which at the moment it’s just Moradin. <span class="spoiler">Though Averill admits he can burn from the inside, but that’s for show-and-tell for another day.</span>

Getting back to the problem at hand, we discuss our next steps in retrieving Twin’s body. Twin suggests we can climb from the window but we remind him that *none of us* are Tabaxi and now that he’s in a human body, there are *limits* to what it can do. 😅 The balcony is about 350–400 feet above us. Fen decides to use [[Dimension Door\|Dimension Door]] but doesn’t know who to take. Zuzu leaves Ashissa but her consciousness go with it.

Meanwhile, Corinne ([[Path in Purgatory/The Party/Coral Eñdosymbíönt\|Coral Eñdosymbíönt]]) has been stealthily investigating the castle and has overheard our *very* loud group. 😅 She decides to take a closer look. She spots us and we definitely stand out as the odd mishmash group of individuals that we are. She recognizes us based on the descriptions provided her mentor. <span class="spoiler">We all provide descriptions of our characters, though Moradin is a 14/10 for dwarven standards but a good New York 7 🤣🤣🤣</span>

Fen (temporarily) leaves with Moradin via dimension door. As they bamf away, Corinne sneaks up behind Averill and whispers into his ear, “Hello.” He immediately turns, putting the blade of his sword to her neck. She eyes the sword and out loud says she’ll “need” it later. Averill asks that she introduce herself, hoping not to shed innocent blood, but uncomfortable with the random stranger sneaking behind him.

Those present, we see an elven woman with heterochromia like Averill (ingdigo eye and a purple eye), showing lots of skin, marked with henna which appears to be all over her body. She’s quite tall, standing 5ʹ10ʺ. She has a sash tied around her waist with a very long tail. She carries herself like a ballerina, graceful. She’s wearing a circlet, a fancy hat, jewelry on her fingers and a necklace with a sun on it. Despite she’s showing a lot of skin, her armor appears sturdy.

She “apologizes” for sneaking behind him, and admits that we may be the group her mentor told her to find. Averill asks her to introduce herself, friend or foe. Twin speaks in Thieves Cant and asks if the Catlord sent her in an indirect way. She acknowledges Twin’s question, but gives no definite answer, only a soft, “Hmmm.” She’s hard to read. 😅 She’s doing some information gathering on a particular person or persons. Averill attempts to question her and she hints that Sovarin sent her, never giving away her name — very beautiful, works closely with Sovereign Luthais, and not a fan of Inara. Corinne is measured with her words and intentional with how she speaks. Cautious Averill lowers his sword, but remains slow to trust, stepping away to create distance.

She asks if Inara is friend or foe to us, trying to read us a bit better. Obviously foe, and we try to make conversation short, as we have more pressing matters to attend, but allow her to join briefly. <span class="spoiler">We were going to walk and talk, assuming Fen’s dimension door worked. With Myron’s permission, Averill would have picked up Ashissa. Twin would have led us and discussed possibly dropping from Inara’s room (~150 foot drop). Again, Averill informs Twin that humans are beyond fragile.</span>

Fen and Moradin apparate as they are shunted back where they were — they vomit due to the abrupt displacement and then notice Corinne. Zuzu flies and Ashissa sees Inara who seems subdued and Sovereign Luthais, who’s pacing and he’s irate. Twin’s body is still.

She notices a strange effect, seeing the wine gathering in the center of the dais. There is no conversation between Inara and Luthais. He clutches the geode around his neck. She then sees a flash of purple and green energy and holds his pose.

Ashissa returns and let’s us know that Luthais is angry. We begin talking next plans to get to the space. Corinne thinks about the space and recalls a few ways to get in (without alarming Inara). Fen then begins to question Corinne, and based on her response decides to put a pin on it justifying that we’ll have one more target should we go into combat. Corinne does admit that Sovarin sent her but we’re still unsure if she was sent to help us. 😓

Fen breifly informs Corinne on what’s going on and what we’re trying to do. She describes Twin’s predicament and how we want to get him back in his original body, though is still unsure on where Myron is. Averill admits to just speaking with him and she throws a quick fit. Twin attempts to trick Fen by talking to her telepathically — it does’t work. 😂

Luthais briefly talked to Ashissa through her mind link (possible through Zuzu?). We have 5 minutes to meet with him in the ritual chamber. “We need to fix what we broke if we want our ‘friend’ back.” We don’t need to worry about the password, but we need to be there asap. 😬 Out of ideas, we sprint to which Twin begins to understand the struggles of a human body. 😂

We begin to run to the the ritual chamber following Twin (Myron). We arrive in front of the door. Before we step in, Moradin comes clean about Graz’zt and what he said to him. As a group we admit to Corinne we walk into traps knowingly. 😅 The door opens, and Twin pushes Averill in.

We see Luthais pacing and notice at the opposite end is that Inara is holding to Twin’s body (a weird image of a 3-foot girl holding a limp 6ʹ5ʺ cat), with a dagger to his neck.

Luthais angrily wants to quell any chance of conversation, though Averill snarkily brings up that Luthais wished to have to talked to Fen and Moradin than Chaos Crew. He threatens us as Inara brings the dagger to his neck.  Moradin attempts to give a business card and Luthais burns it/him with a fire bolt. 

<span class="spoiler">We’re not really taking Luthais seriously despite the threat. 😅</span>

Again, Luthais states we’re not here to have a conversation, that if we want to save Twin we need to restore what he destroyed. Twin, while in Myron’s body, attempts to ask what exactly was destroyed as we were’t there. 😂 <span class="spoiler">Totally canon, the group probably snickered/laughed as he said this. We are insufferable. 🤣🤣🤣</span>  Averill helps him out stating we need more details. 

Luthais then explains that Twin destroyed a precious artifact, and it can be replaced. We have to take care of it in return for our “friend’s” life — to which a couple of us admit friend and even associate is a stretch, not caring that we’re angering him more every time we open our mouths. 😬 

Fen asks what we need to do. Luthais clutches the geode and his hand glows. He rakes his hand across the air, opening a space of shimmer and gleam and light — it briefly reminds Ashissa and Averill of the Shadowfell to which neither want to return. He tells us to look for a specific stone emblem with 6-prongs coming out of it held close to a vast energy source, we need to put the symbol in energy source, once completed he will allow us to return. <span class="spoiler">In hindsight that would have been a bad idea lol.</span>

Ashissa asks if he has several stones on hand, and he describes the process as unpleasant. Using subtle spell and the shard, she casts suggestion on Inara, suggesting to drop the knife and Twin. It doesn’t work.

Luthais asks if we understand, and Fen let’s him know everyone thinks he’s a douche bag. We tell him we need to discuss as a group and huddle up. We’re not necessarily quiet 😂 As we discuss next steps, we take a bit too long arguing whether or not to fight despite Luthais being a Cardinal. Corrine wet willies Averill who sets his boundaries. We get into an argument that prompts Ashissa to cast [[Eldrich Blast\|Eldrich Blast]] at Inara, initiating combat and the rift collapses.

<span class="sticky">Nat 20 initiative for Averill 🥳<br><br>If only my hits were like this 😅 </span>

Luthais recognizes the SunShadow after Averill activates the blade with black and golden flames, looks at him intensely and banishes him to a hall of mirrors. Inara then stabs Twin’s neck, and he collapses. Twin feels as though his soul is being dragged as his body dies. As Myron, he uses Channel Divinity to cast Twilight Sanctuary. 🥳🥳🥳

The group begin to target Inara, (1) she’s weaker after the initial fight with Twin; (2) to save Twin; (3) to ruin Luthais’ plans. Thankfully, Fen has [[Counterspell\|Counterspell]] to limit Luthais’ magic use (especially that first [[Fireball\|Fireball]]).

Corinne uses her ornamental claws while dancing, making music similar to Calamba playing with mystical yarn ball, and gives bardic inspiration on Ashissa. <span class="spoiler">Twin’s first in-game tink. 😂</span>

<span style="width: 303px" class="sticky left cyan">Aaron points out that it was possibly an intense wet willy 😅 though Noelle states Corinne would have moved the claw out of the way</span>

Luthais then uses a legendary action to cast fireball again, which Corrine comes out unscathed due to her [[ring of evasion\|ring of evasion]]. Moradin revives Twin with [[Revivify\|Revivify]] and Twin is shunted back into his body — Fen gets angry and calls Moradin out for not groping Twin inappropriately. Once revived, Inara is slain by Twin, going unconscious, however Luthais is beyond angry and yells. Twin exclaims, “You killed my fairy, I get to yours,” referring to his octopus. 🐙😭

Averill comes back from banishment (nat 20 🥳) and deals the “final” blow on Inara with his shadow on after Fen attacks, both making sure she dies. He winks and says, “That’s for Zuri.” <span class="spoiler">Petty af 😏</span> Luthais (spell DC 21+) quickly changes tactics, angrier than ever, and attacks the guys. Unfortunately, Twin gains 5 levels of exhaustion (possibly from his rapier’s deactivated ability), and goes unconscious again.

Luthais attempts to step towards Inara, but Moradin uses Booming Blade (War Caster) to prevent him from moving further. Luthais stares down at Inara.  Moradin then begins to step on and around Inara in front of Luthais 🫣 and sends healing Twin’s way.

Unfortunately, Luthais goes to attack Twin again, “You need to stay down.” But Fen comes in to save the day with her counterspells. 🥳

Corrine gives bardic inspiration to Fen. We continue to fight and irk him further. He attacks Fen: the first attack she is able to counterspell; second attack she survives thanks to full health and temporary hit points; but his third attack she goes unconscious (probably dead), turning gray and pale, nearly still. 😱

Ashissa’s amulet pulses with energy and she hears, “I can only do this once” (possibly Carilla 👀). The amulet around Fen’s neck glows. Ashssia sees the visions of the Cycled Citadel in Lindhaven, the connection of Carilla and Gaelira resonates in her mind, and a surge of life energy swirls around Fen. Fen is stable and unconscious. 😅👏🏽

Volu looks around, touches Inara, promises to meet us again, and teleports away. Moradin grabs Twin by the ankle and drags him — he eventually carries him over the soldier.

<span class="sticky">Fen saved us from a <a href="Meteor Swarm.md">meteor swarm</a> 😳</span>

We walk back to Sovarin’s office/studio, though before that we do discuss destroying the ritual chamber. We find that Sovarin incapacitated and her amulet has shattered — she is in a drunken stupor. Corrine rushes to her. This is a sudden rush of what has plagued the elves for several months. 😞 Fen argues that Moradin should not *waste* a restoration spell, especially not in the palace as it’s not safe. It’s possible that the amulet that Twin destroyed also was destroyed her amulet. Averill picks her up and pumps a point of Lay on Hands to relieve her pain — Fen later rubs her last dosage of  Keoghtom's Ointment on Sovarin in a show of good faith. ☺️

Grazzt informs that Moradin did not abide by their agreement. Moradin argues that he cannot save his father without his friends. 😭👏🏽👏🏽 The mark continues to burn. He lets us know that Grazzt is angry with us too. Averill suggests he take the Purified Evertide Water and he does — doesn’t get rid of the mark, but regains some health and affected by something similar to a lesser restoration. He obviously needs powerful magic to be released as it might be a curse, such as [[Greater Restoration\|Greater Restoration]].

We walk back to Sovarin’s abode until we realize her place may be compromised. We instead follow Corrine to retreat to her hut in the outskirts, though Twin argues for a bit that he doesn’t want to go to a hut. Moradin and Ashissa quickly add that he can have an input when he can move. 😂

It doesn’t strike us at first, but the more populous spaces of the palace are eerily quiet. We walk into the main hall space … all the elves stare at us standing still. 😳 Their heads turn as we walked past. Corrine casts [[Invisibility\|Invisibility]] on Averill and Sovarin. Fen asks if she banished Averill, pointing out the party just got him back (literally), and Corinne just stares at her blankly, creeping her out.

Freaked out we continue to the lift. Fen then hears Luthais in her head, “I have eyes all throughout the city.” We cannot escape (his watch) ... oooo boy, he angry angry (lol) 😅

<span class="sticky left magenta" style="width: 300px">Most of the Cardinals are magic users and are beyond frustrated with Fen the most because of her counterspells. 😅</span>

We go down the lift of the Arbora Regala. Elves everywhere is watching us, even staring down and up at the lift. We discuss our escape options as we need to leave the city, definitely not stay. Fen knows she can teleports us, but we cannot teleport back without one being somewhere in the castle. Corinne recalls a teleportation circle at the top of the tree near Sovarin’s office. Moradin adjusts the lever and the lift goes back up. 

However, Fen is spent and needs an hour to rest and a “minute” to study the circle. Fortunately, Corrine is able to accurately recreate (draw) the teleportation circle and we go back down.

We decide to go to Sovarin’s house since Corinne doesn’t like the idea of giving away the location of her hut while we’re compromised. We attempt to stealth, but don’t roll well (lol). The merriment and revelry is now quieted as everyone watches us the entire way. We make our way there and keep watch for the next hour as Fen rests in Sovarin’s bedroom. <span class="spoiler">Zuri is gone, no where to be seen. 😌 ... or at least Averill hopes she’s safe.</span>

Moradin tries to offer Fen his pearl of power, then Corinne, but she says no soliciting. 😂 Ashissa grabs Twin and they search for gem dust at Fen’s discretion. Sovarin has small amounts in her art supplies. We briefly discuss taking Sovarin with us, and Averill admits he owes Cadogan a favor.

After 50 minutes, Corinne notices some of the elves make their way to Sovarin’s house. We barricade the doors and windows, and place the [[immovable rod\|immovable rod]] and [[portable hole\|portable hole]] in advantageous spots . Two minutes pass and they begin to bang on the door … five minutes left, there’s wear and tare, especially one of the windows and the front door. We prepare for the onslaught, and Averill says a quick prayer (nat 20 🎶 Living on a prayer 🎶).

A ray of sun comes down distracting the horde momentarily (Aden Vala is under perpetual twilight) — it buys us some time. We get close near the circle as Fen draws. Within the last 5 seconds they swarm in and we escape to Felindra (Verdant Hall). We nearly pass out from the stress.
