>Tensions run high as Corinne finds herself at odds with the aloof and distrusting Nameless Ones, who begin to recap and plan accordingly in regards to dealing with Luthais. Hoping we stalled his plans, we assign Moradin to scry on the Sovereign, and to our detriment, he has revived Inara. Fen and Corinne seek help from the recovering Sovarin and learn about the underground systems under Aden Vala. She gives Corinne a painting that reveals a clue to the entrance, however, Corinne takes it upon herself to examine the painting alone with her expertise, despite Fen and Averill trying to rationalize with her. After a few heartfelt conversations and apologizes, we solidify our plans and prepare for our inevitable encounter in Aden Vala.

</div></div>




Moradin notes that Luthais feels remorse for killing all those fey for his upcoming plans — his tears are genuine. Moradin also sees the demeanor of the mystery elf; his eyes are glazed, as though in a trance, not fully there. The experience through the rift was apparently traumatic and he possibly sacrificed something to complete the stone “task.” 

Twin (jokingly? 🫠) suggests we strike now, though Fen argues otherwise, pointing out that he’s not at full capacity, and that a long rest could make a big difference. We discuss our immediate plans — a full night’s rest and then at first light prepare to re-enter Aden Vala — though we debate whether to go in the morning or at midnight. <span class="spoiler">We know where Luthais will be around midnight based on his routine. Though the underground sounds important for some reason 🤔</span>

Twin suggests that he and Fen travel to Aden Vala so he can steal the stone again. Moradin points out how well that went last time, and Averill chimes in that we have *one* diamond courtesy of Myron. Myron gives Moradin the diamond in exchange for gold. As Twin and Fen discuss the logistics of this particular plan, they realize it may tip (and tick) off Luthais in a way none of us are prepared for. 

Fen argues that we need to stop him rather than delay him. She points out that if we go the next day, or the day after, we at least have one more try than if we wait until the last possible second. She also brings up the fungus and how it might negatively affect her and Corinne, especially in regards to how it assaulted Sovarin.

Averill remarks on how the air didn’t affect Corinne (seeing as she does not have a similar amulet), though she states Sovarin kept her in the outskirts. Fen decides to converse with Sovarin for more details and solutions, reasoning that it affected her so because she had been exposed to the fungus for centuries. Averill continues to express his concerns, recalling how it affected both Fen and Zuri, a half-elf, within a day’s time. Ashissa notes that they were “drugged out.”

Averill offers to use his healing pool, mentioning that his ability can cure disease and neutralize poison — though Fen has a [[periapt of health\|periapt of health]] that she received from him once he gained more abilities as a paladin. (Unfortunately the periapt of health does not neutralize poison.) <span class="spoiler">Lexie attempted to roll an Arcana to learn more about the fungus, but rolled two nat 1s ...</span>

We agree to rest and Corinne hands everyone hand drawn minute notes of our discussion; Averill “the Warden” Kane is impressed and appreciative.

Averill says a quick prayer for protection. 🎶 *I say a little prayer for you~* 🎶

Moradin unfortunately plans something for in the middle of the night. Taking off his armor, he enhances his charisma ([[enhance ability\|enhance ability]]). <span class="spoiler">Chris rolled a natural 20 and Crystal a natural 1 😭 WHY?!</span> 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 He sneaks to Fen’s room, roofies her with an homemade aerosol concoction, attempts to pick the lock, but destroys her doorknob instead with [[heat metal\|heat metal]]. Fen’s trance is interrupted as she is once again under the affects of the Somnia flower, though not quite as potent. 🎶 *So high~* 🎶

>[!meta]-
>**Lexie:** He is a walking predator.
>
>**Crystal:** You guys~! The last time this happened  I thought I could walk up trees!
>
>**Lexie:** He wants you to walk up his tree! 😂😂😂 🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩

As he enters, Moradin disguises himself ([[disguise self\|disguise self]]) as her husband, Elliot, but knows *very* little about how he looks — it’s 8-bit Elliot. 🫠🫠🫠 With smoke and “flair,” he attempts to manipulate Fen and force her to let Elliot go, communicating telepathically via [[message\|message]]. Fen is confounded by the weird apparition-style situation, and is a bit suspicious, but decides to entertain it. 

She begins to question “Elliot,” reminding him that Gaelira already informed her about his condition a week ago. “Elliot” continues to emphasize he cannot stay and that she needs to let “him” go; her love is not allowing him to move on to the afterlife. *C’est tragique.* 😒

Fortunately, Moradin slips, his white lies jumbling a bit, but Fen doesn’t do well with her insight. She states that cannot switch her love off and that she can’t just release him. She takes his words literally, and deduces that she can manifest and put his conscious form into a fey creature so that he could be with her forever — like Zuzu. Obviously it’s possible, as he was in a rabbit just the week before. She admits that he was the better wizard, and it could be his own intellectual aptitude that is keeping him in the Material Plane. <span class="spoiler">High Fen is amazing … 🤣🤣🤣</span> 

Moradin’s disguise flickers the longer Fen talks. He leaves as soon he loses control, and as the situation becomes too metaphysical for him, closing the door behind him. She goes for the door to stop him and burns her hand.

>[!meta]-
>**Lexie:** This is exactly what he needed to get over you. 😂
>
>**Aaron:** Stage-five clinger! 😂

Averill and Corinne wake from the commotion, open their respective doors, and see a flickering human/Moradin. Averill asks him, “What did you *do*, and am I going to be *disappointed*?”

Fen immediately cries out, “Elliot wait!” 🤣🤣🤣 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 <span class="spoiler">Thank you plant-talking Fen!</span>

Without skipping a beat, Averill goes to town on Moradin with Sun Shadow activated and a succession of divine smites, leaving him with 1 hp. 🤬🩸🗡🗡🗡 Corinne goes to check on Fen, who continues to go down the list of animals she could place Elliot in. She breaks down her door and asks her to check on the boys. Myron and Ashissa join us upon hearing the commotion.

Fen attempts to stop Averill, hoping to put Elliot into a weasel. He gingerly informs her that “8-bit Elliot” is Moradin, and he stabs the floor, glaring down at a bloodied Moradin. Corrine calls Moradin out, and before he lies, he looks up at Averill and does the opposite, admitting it really is him. “Put me in a weasel!”

Fen irritably [[Polymorph\|polymorphs]] him into a weasel. Weasel Moradin runs away, and Averill checks on Fen. Everyone notices Fen is off as she explains what happened. She asks Averill if he knew that was Moradin, and he mentions the conversation they had the night before. She proudly states that the soldier pledged to be her sword, and now we all know he took it literally.

Averill offers his room since her door is now compromised, and she asks him to room with her for the night — safety in numbers. Corinne attempts to offer Averill pie, but he declines as Fen doesn’t like it (cinnamon). Myron takes it, and Ashissa asks how he isn’t traumatized. “Takes a bit more than that.” 😛

Averill apologizes for waking everyone, and ushers Fen to bed. Corinne takes an opportunity to blow in his ear and dances around him, pointing out that he’s sweet. 😓🤨🤨🤨

Ashissa sends Zuzu to hunt for (weasel) Moradin, but he’s able to escape and hide. Fen stays up for an hour before going back into her trance — her concentration breaks. The polymorph ends, and Moradin shamefully crawls back to his room. 

We sleep a little bit longer than planned. Ashissa starts on breakfast. Averill explains to sober Fen what happened and offers to switch rooms, and she thanks him for nearly murdering Moradin on her behalf. Corinne knocks and comes in to check on Fen, who now notices her blisters. Fen explains Elliot to Corinne, and that Moradin seems to be the only person who believes he’s dead, and hopes to “woo” her. Averill adds that he has warned Moradin on a couple of occasions. (Apparently, Elliot has been *missing*, or rather trapped in a magical barrier, for three months, and Gaelira has informed Fen that he is safe.)

Corinne understands Averill’s actions, though notes it was excessive. Fen attempts to defend him, pointing out that all he saw was a semi-disguised Moradin running away from her room, and her callout out for her husband. He admits he has quite the temper, and self-control issues in regards to violence — he has sisters, so it was somewhat personal. He bullied bullies growing up.

Fen adds that she knew she could depend on him. He confesses he became a paladin to protect everyone, and extends the offer to Corinne in a show of good faith. She begins to dance around him, but he mentions boundaries and asks her to stop her antics. Fen and Averill both emphasize that he is engaged, and there is a level of decorum to uphold in regards to his personal space. <span class="spoiler">It’s honestly more for her protection than for his comfort ... Zuri don’t play.</span> 

Out of pocket, Corinne says, “There’s always polygamy.” 

<span class="floaterR">

	<p class="caption">Averill after Corinne’s statement</p>
</span>

Fen quickly shuts that down, and Averill admits that’s a no-go. We attempt to deter her by mentioning how Zuri repeatedly tells Ashissa to back off, even though there’s nothing there. Averill attempts to connect the dots and asks why Corinne is entertaining such thoughts. 🤔 She deflects, suggesting that Zuri may like polygamy, she just needs to ask. Averill clearly doesn’t. Fen gives Corinne a free tip: Averill is obviously interested in only Zuri for the rest of his life, until he dies, and will never be interested in anyone else, *ever*. 👏🏽 

Finally, connecting the last dot, Averill asks if she’s interested in him. While she doesn’t answer, she takes Fen’s “tip” as a challenge. Fen warns her that Moradin showed similar patterns in the beginning, and advices not to follow his footsteps. Averill quickly adds Corinne could do better, and Fen jumps in and agrees, listing all his flaws. 🥲 <span class="spoiler">Thanks, boo.</span>

> He’s moody, and sometimes he doesn’t talk for days. And he disappeared one time and didn’t tell us why or where he was going.
>
>—Fen’s commentary on Averill

 <span class="spoiler">If Moradin could join the conversation, he would add, “<em>Unprovoked</em> extreme aggression.”</span>

Based on that *lovely* description, we learn that Averill may be Corinne’s type — and they’re making it worse. 😳 Averill runs away, with Fen’s help, calling out to train with Ashissa, and spars with Myron instead. <span class="spoiler">Ashissa doesn’t want to train with Averill because of last night but she does get quite a show. 😂</span>

We all gather in the galley for breakfast. Averill gives Moradin a look of disappointment, and he keeps his head down in response. Sovarin joins us and Fen asks about her necklace in regards to protection from the fungus. She believes that being in it for such a long time possibly made her more susceptible to it … it’s in relation to the proximity to the trees, especially in regards to Corinne who lived in the outskirts. She doesn’t believe what happened to her will happen to Fen. Sovarin explains that Fen’s resolve needs to remain strong, but even a short period of time may be dangerous, so we need to be hasty.

We then discuss how and when to enter the city while avoiding the horde. If we go around midnight, we have an idea of where Luthais is located, any earlier we would have to hide. Regardless, the teleportation circle is in the tree (Arbora Regala) — we decide to leave at sunset. 

Knowing we have to kill him because he no longer can be reasoned with, we wonder about the leadership situation after. According to Sovarin, the elves have had no need for a king since Luthais declared himself sovereign. While Ashissa and Twin offer themselves up for royalty, Averill looks to Sovarin, who expresses she’s no monarch. She confesses she can rely on past experience to help her people develop a new government system that would be viable in the long term.

>... your people are going to need you, after ... if we’re successful …
>
>— Averill to Sovarin

We continue discussing logistics, agreeing to not burn spell slots for the rest of the day. Fen suggests that Sovarin stay somewhere safe in Felindra and becomes curious about the folding boat, fascinated by her wizardry. Corinne dances, getting prepped with a form of dance kata and pulling out various instruments. Averill takes note of this, though impressed, he’s thinking about how Zuri (bard) could apply similar skills. She winks at Averill. She mentions training, but he wants to establish more boundaries.

Myron and Ashissa talk about training the mind, Averill overhears training wanting space from Corinne for a bit. Myron admits he was able to expand the influence of his mind, and it became natural. Greater distances is a bit of a challenge, though he’s willing to train with her. He explains the process of attuning to the surrounding area and his deity. Her power come from a different place, so the process may differ a bit, but they can work together.

Ashissa introduces both Myron and Averill to crickets, which she claims tastes like sunflower seeds — Myron is not a fan. 😂 Averill admits he’s had worse, recalling the trenches. He then brings up formal dances and offers to teach Myron how to lead, as he did for his brothers.

Moradin works all of the projects he put on the back burner, which results at least one rudimentary prototype. Fen decides to open another page of Elliot’s spellbook, and Twin decides to work on his cat nap.

Averill and Corinne do train and she teaches how to use his body elegantly and gracefully … she incorporates a lot of dancing (i.e. partner dancing, plié, demi, etc.) into her movements, and helps translate his military training to such movements. <span class="spoiler">During the lesson, she throws him off balance while continuing her instruction; he notes he did something similar to Ashissa, who responds saltily, saying he hurt her pride. 😂</span> While sparing, Averill reveals a bit of his former personality, aggressive yet zealous, though at times he’s hesitant, which she uses to her advantage.

<span class="sticky magenta left">And yes, Corinne ... Averill is rarely uncovered. No peaking for you 😅</span>

Ashissa privately meditates, expanding her mind; the presence of the galaxy swirls and spreads out around her, and [[Commune\|communes]] with Carilla, who agrees we should stop Luthais. Ashissa asks about the fungus — if we stop him, while not immediate the effects would lessen as it took time (probably a millennium) for it to build. Again with another hypothetical, she asks if the next course of action would be to visit Belda Sil to reach the tower. Unfortunately, it’s subjective, or mission is dangerous, and no matter what we do, we need to take the utmost care. Carilla tells her they’re all watching.

<span class="spoiler">We learn a bit about the Guilded Wind. There’s about three floors — several bedrooms, a kitchen, storage, etc.</span>

<span class="sticky">Sorry Jacob, it’s between the Neiman Marcus or the Sweet Southern Heat. Got to lay claim to our bougie ship. 😂</span>

Realizing our boat lacks proper bathrooms, Corinne takes a prostitute bath. She later makes Averill a manual of all the moves and what they learned. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 She then updates her henna,

We dock and Fen folds the boat. Intrigued by Corinne’s henna, Moradin receives some facial cobalt blue tribal-like henna while Fen prepares the teleportation circle. Corinne warns him not to touch. We say our temporary goodbyes to Sovarin, and teleport to Aden Vala.

Twin finds himself in a dark room, outside he sees an empty dimly lit round hallway. Everybody then comes through. We attempt to move stealthily behind Twin who scouts ahead. Corinne notes it’s too quiet, eerily quiet — she’s now on high alert. <span class="spoiler">Celebrating Lexie’s natural 20 🥳</span>

We make it to Luthais’ room, not meeting a single soul. We assume he may have already gathered them in preparation for the Void Gate. His door is unlocked. Twin peaks in, no one is present.

Corinne begins to search the room, and notices it’s been picked cleaned. She suggests he may not be in the palace. (Fen internally weeps at the lack of books.) We head to the ritual room, though door is still locked via magical runes. Ashissa prepares to release Zuzu, and holds onto Myron. Averill has his echo check the door, despite Fen offering up Moradin as tribute after he suggests possibly burning it, and echo attacked by vines.

Zuzu inspects the ritual space from the balcony and there is no object in the central dais. The wine isn’t flowing; there’s a few puddles here and there. Zuzu inspects the city from above, finding it void of life.

Twin activates his ability to locate person on Sovereign Luthais. It pulls him downward

Corinne pulls out the painting and has Fen inspect it (natural 20 🥳). She notices the jester pointing down a specific place down in the central square.

Zuzu takes a long dive, and does a quick scan down below. No one is present.

We go down the elevator and a conversation between Twin and Moradin about elves that angers Fen. Averill catches Twin up on what happened last night, and he steps away. 😂

>You let me know, and I’ll make it happen.
>
>— Twin to Fen

We head to the square and realize the painting was an artistic representation — a literal clue. We go to where the jester was pointing. The roots begin to pull up and reveal an open pocket in the ground to a metal constructed ladder.

Twin goes first, about 100 feet down he finds a massive space, 500 by 500 feet. He continues another 100 feet down the stairs before stepping into the space, and the rest of the party follows suit. From wall to wall, we see eleven bodies. There’s a fair amount of magical light in various shades of greens and purples, on the verge of being dimly lit and plays with the eyes. The space opens to several openings and archways … directly in adjacent to the stairway, is a large set of stone doors, though we cannot make details out from the immediate distance.

The bodies are still, eyes closed, but slight breathing. Fen uses her locate gem ability; it directs her towards the ornate doors. Averill uses divine sense, and the fiendish presence has intensified, but there is a slight celestial presence (possibly Laf’Loran).

Moradin casts [[aid\|aid]] on everyone except Myron as we approach the double stone doors. The bodies grow scarce the closer we get. The doors opens revealing a robed figure. As the figure steps forward, We see an older looking gentleman in green robes — it’s Duke Elnaril (Bishop Sania 👀). Behind him follow four hunched “feminine” forms, with elongated fingers, long nails and wispy torn clothing. One hag is extremely pale, almost icy ; another covered in boils with eroded skin ; the horned copper-skinned hag flaunts gnarly curls and glares at us with red eyes ; and finally the last is jet black with deep wrinkles  …

Fen immediately casts [[fireball\|fireball]], and we enter combat with Twin attacking first. Ashissa successfully casts [[slow\|slow]] on Elnaril. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

The icy hag bites into one of the catatonic elves; she snaps their neck as she feasts on them attempting to “frighten” us.  As a collective, our mental fortitude wins out — though, thankfully some of us are obscured in a [[Fog Cloud\|Fog Cloud]] cast by the boil hag. The hags continue attacking with one successfully entrapping Twin in a [[hypnotic pattern\|hypnotic pattern]].

Averill easily takes out two hags (2 natural 20s 🥳) in succession. <span class="spoiler">Corinne has her first tink.</span> Feeling the rush from the fight, he expresses his lack of concerns, purposely egging on Elnaril and the remaining hags to come his way — an improvised super natural nonmagical [[compelled duel\|compelled duel]]. Moradin successfully casts [[bless\|bless]] on everyone.

Corinne throws her pie, casting [[Nathair’s Mischief\|Nathair’s Mischief]] which creates a sticky situation and Elnaril can barely move. 👏🏽 Thankfully, she threw it away from Fen and Ashissa, but they are almost attacked by cinnamon. She grants Ashissa bardic inspiration (d6).

The dark-skinned hag unsuccessfully attempts to impress a magical effect on Fen. Elnaril shifts and contorts, expressing his displeasure as we take out the hags (his favorite toys) one-by-one and suddenly disappears into thin air. After Fen takes out the third hag, Moradin attempts to [[dispel magic\|dispel magic]] to locate Elnaril — it’s not an invisibility spell, but a physical effect. (Keep rolling nat 1s Jacob 😬🙌🏽)

As Averill closes the distance to help Moradin and Myron confront the dark-skinned hag, the party notes that his echo, while completely black holds the same sword but with pure golden flames. 👀👀👀 <span class="spoiler">I see what you’re hinting at, but I’m going to continue being in denial.</span>

Corinne moves her molasses hoping to catch Elnaril almost at Twin’s expense. She grants Averill bardic inspiration.

We eliminate the hags with ease, with the last being eliminated by Myron, and Averill goes to help Twin, who seems to be getting attacked by something invisible. He then senses the swirling form of Elnaril right above Twin with his [[blindsight\|blindsight]]. Ashissa follows up with [[Eldrich Blast\|Eldrich Blast]], and Corinne moves her molasses above Twin’s head.

After attacking Averill, Elnaril attempts to move away, provoking an opportunity attack from the soldier and Twin. He collapses on top of Twin. We continue attack him, despite his physical effect until he uses up his resources. He finds himself surrounded by all the guys. 😈🗡 <span class="spoiler">One more nat 20 for Averill 🥳</span>

Averill suggests that the encounter could end better just as the fear grows on Elnaril’s face. Corrine throws a sharp symbol, cutting the duke across the shoulder.

He attempts to cast a spell, but Ashissa and Fen cast [[counterspell\|counterspell]]. <span class="spoiler">A nat 20 for Fen as she attacks Elnaril 👏🏽</span> Ashissa eventually gets the final blow for 30 points of damage. 🥳

Moradin quickly cuts off Elnaril’s head to add to his collection before Fen burns the body with [[Firebolt\|Firebolt]].
