>Relaxing after dealing with the False Hydra, Myst rejoins the Generic Seven accompanied by Ruby. They all catch up and the next day begin to make their way towards Icewind Dale, and find themselves in Luskan where they find themselves in a fight club.


</div></div>


<div id="luskan" class="map"></div>

Vrok raises his hand to fight. Everyone looks to him and the older gentlemen on the platform waves him over to enter the cage with the goliath champion. The female tabaxi who gave the gentleman his winnings briefly explains the rules to Vrok:

1. [Winning goes] to the first knockout.
2. No armor.
3. No weapons.
4. No spells above 1st level.
5. No lethal damage.

Luk’retia slaps Vrok against the back, casting [[enhance ability\|enhance ability]] (strength) on the ranger. Myst, [[Davena\|Davena]] and [[Ruby\|Ruby]] retreat to the walls, escaping the crowd. Luk’retia and Rez join the crowd to watch the fight.

Vrok dons off his armor, and takes off his shirt revealing scarred pale skin. This prompts the goliath to laugh and taunt him. They enter the cage and begin to fight. Vrok goes to bump fits but the goliath attempts to bash the ranger’s head against his knee and swing. The fight begins. After dodging, Vrok successfully swings, though finds the goliath to be hardy despite adding [[Hunter’s Mark\|Hunter’s Mark]]. He takes a few hits, and gets grabbed by his hair, nearly lifted before escaping the goliath’s grasp (<span class="party glitch"><span>Natural 1</span>Natural 1<span>Natural 1</span></span> for the DM 👏🏽).

The crowd cheers for “Beef Cake,” upsetting his employer. The goliath continues to wail on Vrok (<span class="anti glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span> for the DM), and the ranger attempts to meet his advances as the brawler invades his space. The goliath grows frustrated with Vrok’s nimbleness. Attempting to jump onto the railing (<span class="anti glitch"><span>Natural 1</span>Natural 1<span>Natural 1</span></span>), Vrok decides to choke the goliath (2 consecutive <span class="party glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span>).

The goliath escapes the ranger’s grasp, missing a few swings before delivering a solid uppercut. Vrok taunts him, spitting out some blood, “Is that all you got?” 🤦🏽‍♀️

>How are your knuckles as you hit into “solid rock?”
>
>— referring to the goliath’s Stone Endurance

Evading a couple more hits, Vrok is able to land a decent blow (<span class="party glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span> followed by a <span class="anti glitch"><span>Natural 1</span>Natural 1<span>Natural 1</span></span>).

During the fight, Luk’retia gets excited — though still monotone and emotionless — joining the crowd in their merriment 😳. Myst whispers to Davena that this is the most excited she’s ever seen the cleric, and the wizard agrees. 

The goliath goes for the ranger’s knees and cracks his rib. In retaliation with dwindling health (<span class="party glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span>), Vrok lands a couple more solid punches. “Impressive,” the fighter responds, and proceeds to *attempt* to lift the ranger in the air (<span class="anti glitch"><span>Natural 1</span>Natural 1<span>Natural 1</span></span> vs <span class="party glitch"><span>Natural 20</span>Natural 20<span>Natural 20</span></span>).

The goliath eventually knocks Vrok out with three consecutive pumches, and the crowd cheers in excitement. After being healed by the tabaxi via [[cure wounds\|cure wounds]], Vrok attempts another fist bump but gets a respectful “father-son” hug instead from the champion. The goliath compliments him for his efforts.

The tabaxi runs off, though approaches our group as we reconvene with a round of drinks and the gentleman by her side. He declares the drinks are on him, introducing himself as [[Lord Sternell\|Lord Sternell]]. He attempts to make small talk with us.

>**Sternell:** [...] I can tell that you guys aren’t from around here. Where y’all from?
>**Myst:** (sarcastically) Oh what gave us away?
>Brief pause as he’s taken aback by the yuan-ti’s dry response.
>**Rez:** We’re from —
>**Myst:** (quickly interrupts) All over. 💅🏽

Continuing with the small talk, despite the distrusting  vibes, Sternell expresses his compliments to Vrok. Luk’retia “exits the chat,” observing her surroundings with curiosity. He asks a few more “personal questions” asking where we’re staying seeing as we just got into town. He informs us of inn on the other side of the river, called the [[Mirar River Inn\|Mirar River Inn]]. He offers to take us there considering Vrok was a willing participant. This sets off a few alarms within the party — Luk’retia ears perk at the man’s efficiency. Myst and Luk’retia share a look despite Sternell appearing “*friendly enough.*”

>**Gage:** Why are y’all the way that y’all are?
>[...]
>**Majesty:** Depending on how you have lived life, the things that you have learned, and with *enough* trauma, you just learn not to trust nobody! [...] Everyone’s sus until you get a good read on them and they show their true intentions. 😬
>[...]
>**Gage:** Paranoia isn’t *perfect* awareness.
>**Zerai:** It is naht! I’m just acting the way my character would because she wasn’t engaged in the conversation. (Refer to the paragraph above.)
>**Majesty:** [We’re] not going to act on [our] paranoia, even if it’s there.


Sternell continues, saying it’s the least he can do considering the fights are rigged and Vrok *really* tried his best against [[Wolfgar\|Wolfgar]]. Rez repeats his words though Sternell shushes the blood hunter with a wink. 🤫 As the conversation goes, another specteckle begins in the background.

Vrok expresses he wants to hang with the group for a bit and watch a couple more fights, nearly declining the offer. Myst argues she wants the inn, expressing slight discomfort, and voices they haven’t searched around yet. It’s not a “bad” idea. Rez agrees — the offer is generous — and emphasizes Vrok *needs* rest. 

Luk’retia states she would rather research despite Lord Sternell’s words in regards to the other inns occupancy; she wants to check out the [[Middle Bird Tavern\|Middle Bird Tavern]]. She calls Rez out for being a cheapskate for easily agreeing for a <span class="glitch"><span>free</span>free<span>free</span></span> place to stay. Ashamed, Myst mentions Ruby spent a lot of gold for the entry fee, chiding Rez for snubbing the “meatball” (referring to the gnome bouncer). She learns the fight club isn’t necessarily legal and asks subtle leading questions about it.

>**Myst:** Does that mean *anything* goes?
>**Sternell:** (calculatedly) *Not* in the Fight Club. There’s still rules~!
>**Myst:** (fake smile) *Of course*.
>**Sternell:** We could have killed your friend in there if we wanted to. But we didn’t! Because that would be unfair.
>**Myst:** That’s not really —
>**Sternell:** Killing’s not what we do, it’s just for sport! For fun!
>**Myst:** I wasn’t really —
>**Sternell:** And for gamble!
>**Myst:** (continues) — Wasn’t really implying *that*. But *okay*.

Vrok repays Ruby. Luk’retia asks him to introduce her to Wolfgar, the goliath champion — wanting an autograph. Near Lord Sternell’s platform, the fighter sits at the table enjoying his victory. Vrok limps over, and introduces the two strangers. Wolfgar unsuccessfully flirts with her, kissing the back of her clawed hand as she holds it out for him to autograph. He proceeds to flip her hand over and sign her palm. “You’re welcome!”

Visibly confused and baffled, she corrects him, produces a vial and asks him to sign it. He rolls it in her hand causing the ink to gather onto the glass tube. She corks it and gathers a few sweat drops from his person. 😂 

She begins to ask him a few questions. He trains  often and fights every night, earning 5% of the earnings. A few of us express that how low that sounds. He admits he’s not good with math. Vrok asks if he’s afraid anyone will take the gold. While Wolfgar brushes the suggestion off, Myst points out his physical structure — who wants to deal with *that*? (She joined the conversation after watching Luk’retia ignore his “advances,” somewhat worried for her friend.)

Vrok and Luk’retia ask a few more personal questions about his finances — questions that could be inferred to as premeditated theft if not careful 😅. Wolfgar points to a female golaith across the way — apparently he’s married. 

“Oh you’re *that* type of person,” Myst walks away displeased.

Luk’retia calls Wolfgar out for kissing her hand, though he justifies it was a polite gesture. Confused, she goes to talk to his wife, taking Vrok with her. He purposely stumbles and looks to the cleric to help him up. She just looks at him for a moment before reaching down. He leans against her to whisper in her ear, warning her to watch the [[Dragonstaff of Ahghairon\|Dragonstaff of Ahghairon]].

<span class="spoiler">We’ve been walking around in Dagult Neverember’s sphere of influence with the staff out this whole time?! 😱🤦🏽‍♀️</span>

Wolfgar’s wife is very confident, showing no reaction to her husbands “affection” towards other women; it’s part of the show and “he’s just playing the game.”  Luk’retia asks if she believes Wolfgar is being treated right regarding the low earnings. She manages his finances and makes sure he gets every coin — truthfully he earns 15%. 

Excited, Luk’retia attempts to bond with the woman, wanting to learn more about the club, training, her home life, etc. Rather than fight, his wife loves farming and gardening. They live on the outskirts. The cleric gleans some information from the female goliath in regards to the inns; they’re more full on this side of the river. She then asks if we could stay at the goliath’s farm, however they have a family reunion to host (20+) in a one bedroom house.

Wolfgar’s wife suggests she go to Lord Sternell who has another in. Luk’retia attempts to justify her search, listing absolute her necessities for tavern/inn amenities. Craftily, Myst gently comes up to Luk’retia and tells her she wants to go, reiterating how uncomfortable she is. The women share a quick goodbye and a couple of awkward smiles — the yuan-ti gives the goliath a knowing look, and nods as she leads her friend away.

Luk’retia turns her attention to her friend, who states she hates crowds. Myst also mentions the cleric was overwhelming the stranger by getting in her business. They exchange a few words on social etiquette in regards to exchanging personal information, and establishing relationships to require said information. 

Luk’retia mentions the [[Middle Bird Tavern\|Middle Bird Tavern]], possibly wanting to scope it out, saying it smelled nasty. Myst expresses her disgust, convincing her friend that the most efficient option would be to take Lord Sternell’s offer, despite the suspicious around it. She reiterates Ruby paid a lot of gold, implying a free stay wouldn’t be so bad on the group’s wallet.

Luk’retia hugs Myst, whispering to her that Vrok warned her that “they” want the dragon staff. Concerned, the yuan-ti asks why she has it out, and urges her that she needs to be more careful with the dragon staff as they travel further north. She continues explaining that the dragon staff is an *important* magical item with *great* power. It would be unfortunate if it got into the wrong hands — especially back into the hands of a certain Lord Dagult Neverember.

Luk’retia questions why she didn’t warn her before. Myst admits her mind has been preoccupied with other things, and she apologizes. Vrok tells Myst they need to watch the cleric’s back, and she agrees. He suggests they take the offer and when they arrive at the inn, they’ll take precautions. They both offer to set up an [[Alarm\|Alarm]] spell in the room.

Luk’retia then asks if she should call [[Aurinax\|Aurinax]], believing the staff can call on dragons, though Myst advices against it. Dragons want to be left alone. The cleric argues that if he doesn’t want anyone to have it, he should retrieve it to protect it. However Myst retorts it would be arguably better to break it and dispel the magic, or at least be more aware of when they have it out — it could potentially be useful in the future.

>It doesn’t just [command Aurinax], it [commands] *a lot* of dragons. It [commands] dragons! If you have the power to command dragons, you are like nearly unstoppable! That’s dangerous.
>
>Anybody would want to have that power, especially the wrong people. ... And we’re now getting closer to territory where wrong people are located.
>
>— Myst in regards to the dragon staff

Luk’retia suggests going to another time, however, it’s unfortunately well into the evening. Vrok reiterates the previous plan to accept Sternell’s offer and set up precautions. He also mentions needing rest to heal a few broken bones. The cleric contemplates giving the older gentleman a warding stare, though Myst states it would only entice him more. Don’t attack too early and engage any more than necessary without more information.

As the conversation continues, the three reconvene with the rest of the party. Davena converses with Rez, surprised he didn’t join a fight. 

>**Davena:** We have time if you want to jump in?
>**Rez:** No, I’m good.
>**Vrok:** You can probably face the meatball!
>**Rez:** I ain’t fighting that meatball.
>**Davena:** You can face that meatball. (laughs) He’s got some *beef* with you anyway!

Davena reveals she loves puns, and Myst asks about other things she likes as the boys approach Lord Sternell. Davena likes music, books, chocolate — anything simple really. Myst points out the tiefling’s earrings, which are decorated with amythests that compliment her purple skin, an early [[Winter’s Crest\|Winter’s Crest]] present from Vrok. The yuan-ti takes a mental note, and inadvertently creeps the tiefling out a bit.

Glad we’re taking him up on his offer, Sternell explains he wants to increase business at the [[Mirar Inn\|Mirar Inn]], hinting that it’s practically empty. He gives us a brief night tour through the city, sharing information about the river, how the Mirabar East trades with Luskan at the coast, how the city has an advantage at getting imported goods to their ports. He prattles on, and as an older gentleman he makes a few remarks about the young folk and the “good ol’ days.”

Recalling increasing business, Luk’retia asks him where he gets his ale; he mentions [[Durnan\|Durnan]] from [[the Yawning Portal\|the Yawning Portal]]. Luk’retia attempts to sell him on her invention of blueberry ale, mead, etc. Myst is not amused, glaring a whole into the back of her friend’s head and sending a glare to a giggling Vrok.

>**Luk’retia:** It’s very delicious and we have a unique source that is a secret. 😉
>**Sternell:** Oh, interesting!
>**Myst:** (maliciously) And not hygienic. 👹
>**Rez:** The distilling process says otherwise.
>**Luk’retia:** Yeah, I don’t know what she’s talking about!

He asks for a business card, which she promptly produces with the Blueberry Snake logo and all. “Through the mage relay, you can contact us at ...”

Myst threatens the group with her Wild Magic, but isn’t taken too seriously. Rez points out how ungrateful she sounds, earning a predatory glare from the peeved yuan-ti. She hates them so much. 😂 Luk’retia expresses she doesn’t understand, and Vrok attempts to talk her down.

We enter the Mirar River Inn and meet an Aasimar woman, with auburn hair in a half braid. She welcomes us in, and upon Lord Sternell’s request gives us plenty to eat and drink. She informs us there are plenty of rooms for us to have on our own.

Exhausted from travel, Sternell bids us goodnight, rejecting Luk’retia’s invigorating concoctions. Though she mentions a sleep over, a majority of the group want their own rooms. Davena voices she’s been wanting privacy for some time. Vrok asks about a bath, and the Aasimar offers directions, though the bathroom is only big enough for one person — two if patrons are feeling adventurous. Vrok offers that Luk’retia can join, confusing her based on her recent interactions with men. 😂 He attempts to justify it was for her safety.

Myst asks Davena in private about her and Vrok. It’s a weird conversation. Davena defends the ranger, informing the yuan-ti that he got everyone a gift. Myst pulls out her necklace and infers it matches the tiefling more than it does her. Davena feels unnerved by the curious yuan-ti, especially after Myst curls Davena’s hair behind her ear.  The tiefling attempts to assure the yuan-ti, but Myst admits she doesn’t really care. She was only curious.

Davena almost accepts the necklace, attempting to appease the yuan-ti. Myst corrects her; she wasn’t going to give it to her. 😛 She continues, stating she’s misread her intentions. She was just asking questions. Before letting her go, Myst admits it would have been okay if something *did* happen, attempting to comfort the tiefling, but succeeded in throwing her off more. 

Once the “interrogation” is over, Davena retreats to convene with the rest of the group for dinner. She eats a bit faster, though Luk’retia warns her she’ll choke. Myst goes up to the Aasimar and asks for raw meat, allowing her to eat in the kitchen. 🩸🩸🩸

>**Zerai:** Is Myst acting weird now that she’s back? Like [...] cause it’s my *friend*, and I want to pay attention?
>**Majesty:** I would say you get the idea she’s a little more comfortable in her skin. That’s all.
>**Gage:** (low) We need to put a stop to *that!*
>[...]
>**Majesty:** She seems comfortable. [...] When you first met her, she seemed more unsure of herself, and scared of a lot of things. There’s some growth here.

Vrok warns the group about Lord Sternell and to watch Luk’retia closely. Apparently, the older gentleman was eyeballing the dragon staff. He informs them that he and Myst will set up a few precautions before bed. Rez asks if they need to destroy it, but Luk’retia thinks it’s too pretty.

Before he goes to bath, he repeats to them to protect Luk’retia. Rez tells him to go lay down, recalling his bruised torso, and assures the ranger they will be extra secure. The blood hunter takes stock of the inn, noting two other patrons who talk quietly amongst themselves. The Aasimar has busied herself with a book.

With bloody hands and mouth, Myst finally comes out of the kitchen after devouring the remaining five rabbits. She drops a few gold on the counter, apologizes and asks for a napkin. The Aasimar hands over her apron, which she gratefully accepts. As Luk’retia approaches, Myst shyly adds she’s seen her like this before. The cleric gives a knowing nod.

Rez asks how long we plan to remain in Luskan, though Myst voices they need to continue north. They only need to stay for the night. Ruby confirms. He asks about supplies and Davena confirms we’re good considering we got room and board for free. He then leaves to go to sleep so we can leave at dawn.

>**Majesty:** Question — what was the biggest piece of meat in [the kitchen]?
>**Chelsea the DM:** Um, you found a rabbit.
>**Majesty:** Just a rabbit?! Dang. (pause) How many then?
>**Chelsea:** There was five.
>**Majesty:** (without missing a beat) I ate them all.
>**Stephen:** (gruff accent) Low stock here boys; no more rabbits! No more meat.
>**Majesty:** I was hoping for like a cow.
>**Stephen:** You know you can eat horse right?
>**Majesty:** Yeah, I know. ... I’m trying not to, I need a ride 🫠

Luk’retia then asks the Aasimar about the baths.  The Aasimar justifies they never felt the need to build another because of low traffic. The cleric advices they promote more options to increase healthy customer experiences. Apparently Lord Sternell makes those decisions, so it almost falls on deaf ears. The Aasimar then mentions the tub is big enough for two, believing the cleric to be upset.

Luk’retia inquires about more options, but it’s a simple inn — not much to do other than eat, bathe and sleep. The Aasimar offers to let her read her book, *The Cursed Keepers*. It’s about three unlikely heroes that come together and take an adventure through the Feywild learning about their fates. Myst interrupts, “But that’s the beginning though.”

This irks the innkeeper 😂 who continues. She’s currently at the part where the group is on the cusp of freeing a witch from a prison —  though she’s not too sure. She’s still reading; her favorite character is Olive, who has a tragic backstory. She group up rich, ran away from home, which was more like a prison. Luk’retia tells her she expects updates. Myst has to stop herself from spoiling the book. 😂

<span class="spoiler">It was implied there is a sequel for <em>We Were Snakes</em> ... beware 🐍.</span>

The Aasimar nearly tells the girls to buzz off so she can finish her book swiftly and quietly, though offers to provide more towels, etc. Luk’retia asks for towels. The Aasimar runs to the back and hands her additional towels. Once Vrok leaves, the cleric enters the bath and finds a decent amount of stocked towels. She asks Myst to keep her company, and the yuan-ti obliges. Luk’retia plays with Anisha for a bit as they bathe.

The rest of the group begin to assign themselves their own rooms. Rez enters his room, immediately locks it and places a door jam. Vrok chooses a room, though Ruby rooms next to him and begins to incessantly knock against the wall. “There’s rats in the walls!” 😂

The kobold’s disturbance, prompts Davena to open her door and ask about the racket as Vrok moves to a room far from Ruby. He grumbles in annoyance. He waits for Luk’retia and Myst to choose a room to begin setting up the [[Alarm\|Alarm]] — Myst prepares the door, and he prepares the window.

Vrok attempts to ask Myst to join him, but she points out his broken rib. He presses, implying she could heal his rib, but she argues she’s no healer — not one single healing spell available in her arsenal. He clarifies he meant in a sentimental loving way, but she emphasizes his broken rib. Within earshot, Luk’retia offers to heal him and casts [[Cure Wounds\|Cure Wounds]]. She questions him — why would he ask Myst? She then asks if he meant sexual healing, which makes Myst uncomfortable.

Luk’retia asks if Vrok he has a disguise kit — he has [[Disguise Self\|Disguise Self]], and Myst adds she knows [[Alter Self\|Alter Self]], however the spells only work on the casting individual. She admits if she were proficient in a disguise kit she would have used it a long time ago. 🥲 

Luk’retia reveals she wants to change the appearance of her [[bag of holding\|bag of holding]]. Myst assures her not all bags of holding look alike, that one cannot grab anything without knowing the contents of the bag, and to reveal said contents, one would have to flip the bag inside out, shunting all the items out while temporarily disabling the bag. This concerns the cleric who has dangerous poisons in the bag. However that’s an extreme scenario.

She slides the dragon staff into the bag. Vrok leaves, bidding the girls goodnight to complete his four hour trance.

Myst then asks Luk’retia for advice in regards to the necklace she received from Vrok.  She asks about Davena’s earrings as well. She mentions she felt dismissed at one point, expressing how upset that particular moment left her. She feels unseen. Confused, Luk’retia asks her to elaborate, and Myst admits he wanted him ask. 💡💡💡

Putting two and two together, Luk’retia goes on a long rant, attempting to explain how Myst feels about the situation between her and Vrok: the past intimacy, the apparent distance, the potential jealousy towards Davena, and now the dismissal. Myst admits she’s not jealous nor possessive. Luk’retia mentioned possession having read something weird in the library back in Neverwinter, and accusing Rez of being a masochist. 😂 Myst disagrees, he does more of the “pushing around,” but quickly dismisses it, not wanting to know about Rez’s activities.

Luk’retia then defends Vrok, explaining his thought process and how she helped him. He in turn helped her find a gift for Rez — light up underwear with an evergreen conifer (Christmas tree) around the ✨AHEM✨.

>I thought he needed to cheer up and light up his Christmas tree! 🎄 But not by me.
>
>— Luk’retia boasts proudly about her gift 🤣😭

Myst blinks in horror, though tries not to laugh. She shifts the conversation back to the original topic, recalling her parents relationship. Unfortunately, Luk’retia doesn’t catch the shift and assumes her father *also* had Christmas tree underwear. That is not the case. 😭

Myst justifies she may be overthinking things and ends the conversation. Luk’retia attempts to rectify it, realizing they were on a different page, but Myst only assures that she’s great. Before the cleric can protest, Myst thanks and hugs her.

Still confused Luk’retia repeats what Myst admitted earlier. She’s not a jealous woman. She then asks if the yuan-ti is attempting to push Vrok on another woman. Not that either. Myst then halfheartedly claims jewelry is intimate. Luk’retia explains men think simply and assume women love receiving jewelry. Vrok took a lot of time to choose it. Myst then concludes, “It’s the thought that counts.”

Myst attempts to pry from Luk’retia, asking if something happened between Vrok and Davena. She doesn’t believe so — the only thing that was of concern was when she hit her head. Luk’retia asks if she’s concerned with cheating, however on Anguis’Conda, the concept of cheating didn’t exist as most marriages were political. Her only other example would be Art who was in an open relationship with “everybody.” She ends the conversation and they prepare for bed, interacting with Anisha for a bit.

The girls situate themselves, placing the bag between them. Luk’retia calls for Anisha to protect it, and she curls around the bag. 👏🏽 The cleric thanks her and offers to get her special meat upon request, though Myst clarifies she’s a spirit rather than an actual animal.

While that happens, Rez wanders around town for a bit, attempting to look for anything off in the city. He comes short, and returns to bed for the night.

>One day these sequences will be revealed — until then, they remain secret. 🤫

Rez wakes up in the middle of the night. He hears soft footsteps outside his door as the floors creak under the weight. He hears a small sniffle and realizes it may be one of the girls. He goes outside to see who it is. He opens his door and finds Davena lightly step down the hallway to the set of stairs that lead upwards to the floor above.

He takes off his boots, and follows behind her with his dagger up to the second floor. She finds a smaller staircase that leads up to the roof. She opens the door gasping softly, as a blast of cold air hits her, and she is illuminated by color. Before she walks up, she looks down and sees him.

They both step out onto the rooftop. The night sky is illuminated by the glow of dancing lights, with swirls of green, purple, and blue that ripple in the night. A minute or so into the light show, she finds a small spot to sit, knees tucked under her chin. She apologizes for waking him, revealing she just suffered a nightmare. He admits he also had a nightmare — he has a lot of regrets and missed opportunities.

She inquires about his “dream,” which was about all the issues they’ve had on the trip and his fiancée going missing. He rationalizes that enough time has passed to admit she’s gone. He thought he knew his plan in life and the right thing to do — he doesn’t know anymore. The future is uncertain. All he has is his next choice: get to [[Icewind Dale\|Icewind Dale]]. He voices that along the way he’ll need to do the best he can to not hate himself.

She gestures on the spot next to her; he takes it. She recalls her own nightmare having a similar connotation, she has a lot of regrets of her own. She reveals she’s from a whole other world. She was going to stay, but her duty comes first. She dreamt about the dragon who destroyed an entire small village, no survivors — it made no sense as there was nothing special in the town. The worst part is that she wishes it was a dream ...

She admits she almost killed herself and her first party in an attempt to go after the dragon. She wanted to do the right thing. She recognizes they weren’t really her friends and definitely weren’t as welcoming as our group.

>**Davena:** I guess I was stupid.
>**Rez:** Not necessarily. Cause who’s going to step up for the moments, just let every disaster that comes through, and just wave it on by? Out of every adventurer out there, they will just wave it on by.

He continues that we (adventures) don’t do it for fame or fortune without expecting danger. We can’t take the easy road and get satisfaction from it. We’ll have our rough moments and make the worst choice, even if it’s morally correct. That struggle sets everyone apart on the path they take. “What if that one moment of you even distracting the dragon set up one moment for someone to escape?”

She tells him what really happened. She mentions she didn’t give us a lot of detail because she was afraid we would forsake her like the previous group. She took on a research assignment for the Cobalt Soul in [[Exandria\|Exandria]] (specifically [[WIldemount\|WIldemount]]). A new scholar unlocked a new type of transportation circle to aid in arriving in Faerûn ([[Candlekeep\|Candlekeep]]). He found that Faerûn had interesting insights on politics that could help the Cobolt Soul take down the Cerberus Assembly, a corrupt organization  who sought to increase war efforts between the Dwendalian Empire and the Krynn Dynasty.

Davena admits she was the first to volunteer because she was not an official member of the Cobalt Soul, just an initiate. She arrived in Candlekeep and was assigned a party who would escort her to Icewind Dale to find the lost city of Ishavael. The leader was Theo, a half-elf paladin. The rest of the party included a rouge, barbarian, druid, cleric and fighter. They showed her around and she tells Rez she saw the Generic Seven during the Day of Wonders Parade. (Apparently we’re celebrities.)

After the parade ended, they took off towards the northeastern direction. While she thought they were an excellent team, the rogue and druid didn’t trust her. They fight every opponent with ease, until they happened upon the small town on their way to Heaven’s breath. The encounter was a failure, most of them survived, though the village was decimated. Filled with righteous anger and a thirst for justice, she proposed they avenge the village.

“You can’t save everybody.”

Her proposal was dismissed and others suggested doing something else. They were tired and warn, only taking short rests since leaving the parade. She got into a disagreement with Theo, who she regarded as her very first friend — there were some romantic implications. A party divided, Davena went with the barbarian and fighter to slay the dragon. They found the lair and made a mistake; even when the rest of the party joined, they still failed. Almost everyone died.

The druid’s last move was to cave in the lair, and Theo find them a way out, though took it upon himself to stay behind and distract the dragon as they escaped. Only she, the rogue and the druid survived — they blamed and abandoned her. She continued on her own towards Heaven’s Breath and found the Generic Seven.

Rez admits there is regret in every decision. She expresses those regrets, wishing she hadn’t confronted the dragon. He offers a new perspective, arguing that her wish minimizes Theo’s sacrifice.

>**Davena:** I do regret some choice words.
>**Rez:** We all do. But if you don’t you’re not living.

Davena mentions Theo asked her to stay in Faerûn, and she would have taken his offer. She states there’s nothing for here here, though Rez asserts there was nothing for her back home either. 🫢 He tells her she has a place with the Generic Seven, regardless if it’s not enough or not the path she wants to take.

Rez takes a moment to sit in silence, before he stands and pats her on the back as he heads back to his room. She gets up and follows.

Morning comes and Vrok wakes to his [[alarm\|alarm]] triggering, running into Myst and Luk’retia’s shared room triggering Myst’s alarm. Everything is where it’s supposed to be, except for the slightly ajar window. Myst looks at him crazy as he just stands there. He then explains. He apologizes as she goes to close the window. We’re all good. Davena joins at the door, inquiring about the ruckus.

Rez exits his room, bag over his shoulder and ready to go. Noticing we’re all up, Davena suggests we go down for breakfast then asks for Ruby. Myst moves past everyone followed by Vrok and they goes to check on Ruby. The door is unlocked and the kobold out about in the town, leaving a note to inform her escorts. Myst isn’t too concerned and sings her praises once more.

The inn is lifeless — the Aasimar and the two patrons are no where to be seen. The fire in the fireplace is dying, and the room gets colder by the minute. Luk’retia wants to leave immediately, feeling suspicious of her surroundings. Myst asks about the bag, and we’re gucci. 👌🏽

Rez points out that Luk’retia is skittish. She mentions her nightmares and so does Vrok. It appears as though the whole party is <span class="anti glitch"><span>exhausted</span>exhausted<span>exhausted</span></span> from the experience.  Luk’retia  explains it’s weird how it’s empty in the tavern, though Rez points out it’s early in the morning (4am) and it’s not a popular hangout.

Ruby returns with a sack of coffee beans. She greets us excitedly at the prospect of coffee. She’s not tired like the rest of the group. Considering our location, Luk’retia asks if she stole it, possibly bought it, or even traveled to a farm. “I forget.” 😂

Ruby telepathically links with Luk’retia and offers her insight to her latest exploits. She stole it from a nearby tavern. 🤣 Myst proudly states Ruby is a law-abiding citizen, repeating the kobold’s words as she paid the entry fee for the Macho Glory Inn. Ruby and Luk’retia immediately conspire with no rehearsal to confirm Myst’s statement.

Luk’retia then asks if Ruby saw anything suspicious while walking about. Other than it being cold in the inn, she didn’t notice anything. She runs to the kitchen to kindle the fireplace, and prepare some needed coffee.

Suddenly, Lord Sternell walks in, friendly pleasantries long behind him. His sources informed him of our celebrity group — we know too much about his business associate, Dagult Neverember. At the snap of his fingers, we find ourselves surrounded by armed masked individuals. In a puff of smoke, Lord Sternell is gone.
