</div></div>


[[Runi\|Runi]] deals with the grieving town of [[Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]] as the Generic Seven convene at the local inn. After buying drinks for the party, Luk’retia gets up to go to the baths though sees two figures walk in, Myst — no longer blue, with looser curls, a few strands streaked black, and now standing at her original height — accompanied by [[Ruby\|Ruby]], from [[Fen’s Neeldes\|Fen’s Neeldes]] in [[Westbridge\|Westbridge]], who holds her hand reassuringly. Unfortunately, she doesn’t recognize her immediately.

Myst sees the party at their table, though notices a purple tiefling with them and hesitates. Ruby pulls her along and she acquaints herself with [[Davena\|Davena]]. Luk’retia greets her with a hug, expressing how chaotic the past few days had been without her. Myst implies she knows about their tiff.  Rez speaks up, greeting her, and asks what she heard — his first friendly interaction with the yuan-ti. 

His “new” demeanor scares Myst, who is somewhat taken aback and expresses this out loud. Luk’retia adds he’s been “chatty” as of recent, believing Davena to be the cause. This prompts the tiefling to greet Myst, and quickly states the party was nice enough to allow her to travel with them. She mentions once she gets to [[Isavel\|Isavel]] she’ll be out of their hair, and that she won’t step in and replace her. Myst gives her a confused look. “That’s a weird thing to say.” The interaction is hella awkward. 😅

Myst begins to answer Rez’s question, having heard things were tense (revealed later from the [[Gresham\|Gresham]] in [[Tribor\|Tribor]]), and quickly adds she has been traveling with Ruby. Ruby acknowledges Rez, who sarcastically responds under his breath — “They just let anyone in this place, don’t they?”

Vrok calls out Myst’s name; she responds back with his own. He hugs her, glad to see her and tells her he missed her. Ruby takes the opportunity get on the table and stares at Rez smugly, striking some small talk. Vrok continues to engage with Myst, asking about her travels. Myst admits it was enjoyable and found Ruby to be great company. 

<span class="spoiler">While neither say anything, both Vrok and Luk’retia felt something move beneath Myst’s furs.</span>

Ruby emphasizes Myst’s comment towards Rez. “I am *quite* the delight, if you had just taken five seconds, by the way.” Rez *politely* addresses her, which appeases her and she jumps down. He makes a snide comment about her height in comparison to the table, referring to it as a magic trick. She adds she’s full of tricks. Myst begins to sing her praises, mentioning how Ruby single-handedly banished a group of bandits. It’s obvious the yuan-ti admires the kobold — a fraction of her admiration being that she helped remove her curses. 🥰🥰🥰

Luk’retia expresses her disappointment, and Rez joins saying profits will tank, especially now that they don’t have their “mascot.” The brand is meaningless. 🙄 Though, Luk’retia attempts to soften the blow, but relating the color blue to Myst and how beautiful she is. Myst agrees, but argues she’s beautiful when not blue. Rez confirms which throws her for a loop, and she calls him out. Apparently, a few individuals called him out for his behavior, and now he’s fixing it. Myst admits she does’t like this sudden change.

Luk’retia sheds some light on his new demeanor, adding that Davena also spoke out against him. She shifts the conversation back to blue, voicing it made it easier to pinpoint the yuan-ti in a crowd. Myst attempts to dispute her point, but the cleric implies she blends with the crowd. Myst tells her to either look for her scales, or for her eyes, especially at night.

“Glad you’re back to your normal self,” Rez utters as Luk’reta compliments her friend’s eyes. She tells her to always look at her, and Myst promises to make an attempt. Rez softly mutters, “Suspicious.” <span class="spoiler">That’s right, I caught that! 👀</span> 

Myst knows she’ll probably be blue again, but will try her hardest to prevent it. Luk’retia mentions adding visible blue accents, but the yuan-ti admits blue is not her favorite color. As they discuss this, Ruby interjects Myst is escorting her shop to [[Targos\|Targos]], after Rez says she ruined their business. He confuses her role, believing she was an either a baker or an apprentice, but she corrects him as she was only there to help Fen. She helps adventurers assimilate to normal life.

On the side, Luk’retia asks if Vrok sent his paper bird to Myst, though she only received one from the cleric.

“You help [them] assimilate [...] through seamstry?” Rez asks, confused how a *normal* seamstress could be so multitalented. Myst asks how being a seamstress would limit her capabilities and gifts. She makes herself as an example, though she’s adventuring she truly wants to be a scholar of sorts. She turns on him, inquiring about his hobbies and interests outside of monster hunting, only to learn he has none. 😐🙃 She argues he needs hobbies before he retires, and he agrees. 

“I need to get used to this *new* him,” she says flabbergasted. 

Curious, he asks “What did you expect to happen?” She expected him to (1) ignore her as he usually did; (2) physically push her around so she’s not in his way, and (3) not acknowledge her existence. Davena loudly expresses her astonishment. Myst continues that technically out of self-preservation it was for the best, as when they first met he deemed her a monster — he’s not wrong. Vrok chimes in, confirming her statements. Thinking back, Rez cannot rebuff.

“We had a very limited interaction that I was okay with, so this is weird!”

Davena points out Rez’s trust issues, mentioning he originally thought she was sabotaging them. Luk’retia and Vrok affirm her statement. Rez defends himself, implying there was more going on. They argue for a bit about what happened before they encountered the wendigo.

Luk’retia abruptly stops the argument, “We. Are. Growing.” Myst apologizes, not meaning to have everyone turn on him, but she wanted to express her concerns. It’s all very ✨ *new* ✨.

>**Myst:** So you might regress~ ...?
>**Rez:** (quickly with emphasis) I regress everyday. 😂😂😂

Luk’retia then apologizes about their smell, and Myst notices they’re pretty beaten. She’s understanding, relating it to the smells of the jungle and she’s smelled worse. Luk’retia and Davena rave about the baths, easily convincing the Yuan-ti.

[[Ernie\|Ernie]], a red dragonborn, hands out out tankards of the cheapest ale in response to the candlelight vigil. The air of sadness continues to linger in the air as the people express their grief for their loved ones. Myst inquires about the atmosphere.

The group met Runi, a short woman, who is currently doing crowd control. When they arrived, she was investigating the strange disappearances around town. They joined and helped her. Davena adds that she fell, and Vrok continues explaining their misadventure, though Myst turns her attention to Davena, expressing her concern. Eventually, they found the [[false hydra\|false hydra]]. Ruby explains that once people are eaten, they are forgotten but are remembered after the hydra was defeated. Luk’retia explains that the tortle baker forgot about his wife and their life together, despite seeing photographic evidence.

Luk’retia mentions she’s going to the baths and hopes to try her herbal concoction. Ernie walks by and politely requests she clean up after herself this time. 😂 

Before heading upstairs, Myst asks about the necklace Luk’retia gave her. She pulls out a matching necklace and admits she wanted to make sure she was safe. Myst clarifies she wants to know about the magic placed on it and why.

>[!spoilers]-
>Cue suggestive hand gestures as the DM and our cleric recall what’s up  👉🏼👌🏼
>Girl what did you do? 😅

Luk’retia repeats herself, placing the magic on her own, so they have a matching set. Though doesn’t tell her what it would keep them safe from (Nat 20 Deception 😒 <span class="glitch">rude</span>). Myst gathers she doesn’t want to say anything while in front of the boys. She looks to Vrok and they agree to talk later.

Myst notices Davena doesn’t join, and extends the invitation. She wants to stay behind as she’s modest. While Myst accepts her answer, Luk’retia suggests she join. Myst defends Davena’s decision, though in doing so, she curses at the realization. She then urges they can go when no one else is around. Ernie quickly interjects that it’s empty.

Luk’retia fills Myst’s ears about the deceased next great adventure, though no one in the town appreciated her sentiments. Myst comforts her, believing that in time they’ll understand. They continue to catch up out of earshot of the rest of the group with an excited Ruby in tow. Luk’retia inquires about Art. Myst admits she doesn’t feel better and doesn’t want answers. “I’m angry,” she adds with a smile. May be some revenge in store, and the cleric agrees to help as his death was unjust.

Eventually, they reach the baths and though, Myst is cautious at first, she allows her friend to see a gruesome sight. Luk’retia attempts to soothe her but she flinches in pain. Myst also reveals the huge freaking snake hiding under her clothes. 😂🐍

Back at the table, Davena points how awkward meeting Myst was, and Rez immediately asks if she afraid she’s third wheeling. 🤯👀🤯 She urges him to clarify, and he tells her she’s the “new” magic caster. She expresses she’s more concerned about feeling as though she replaced Myst. She then veers the conversation towards his change of heart; Vrok is curious too.

Rez admits that his anger and hostility led to his fiancée leaving, voicing it as a terrible way to leave her memory. Davena sympathizes with him, and adds bad things happen. He understands, describing his frustration with the missed opportunities along the way. They talk about the aftermath of the false hydra and Vrok wonders if they did more harm than good. Davena puts some perspective into the situation, stating that it could have been worse.

>We want to remember those who died. While it hurts, at least you had them for the time you had them for. [...] The whole city could have been lost. Now they have a chance to rebuild.
>
>— Davena

Rez picks up that Vork wants to go to bath, and calmly says “Just leave them alone.” 😂 Vrok expresses he was going to go regardless, but will wait. <span class="spoiler">Apparently, there was a conversation about sharing a shower ... y’all what? 🍵👀👀</span>

Davena interjects she’ll to drown out her awkwardness with her drink, prompting Vrok to ask about it. She feels like she made a fool of herself and assumes Myst believes she’s being replaced. She has anxiety and iterates she’s not here to replace her. Vrok states no one can replace her, and Davena notes he hasn’t gone to go see her. He wants to be alone with her. Once Luk’retia gets involved, not only is it chaotic, but it’s hard for him interject. 😂

Rez is long gone, attempting to find a private bath with no luck. 🤣

In the baths, Myst introduces Luk’retia to Anisha, a 5-foot, yellow-eyed, black snake. Luk’retia gets excited about the name, as they both named their “companions” with A’s, gesturing to Antari, who has grown and woven a circlet around her head. 🕷️ She asks where she found Anisha, though Myst admit she’s a familiar — a spirit that takes animal form. Questionable if it’s a girl, though there’s something menacing about her. 

<div class="definition">
	<h3>Anisha</h3>
	<span class="pronounce">\ aniśa \ <em>also</em> अनिशा</span>
	<hr>
	<p><strong>:</strong> “nightless, sleepless” in Sanskrit<br><strong>:</strong> uninterrupted, incessant<br><strong>:</strong> continually (thinking about something)<br><strong>:</strong> eternal</p>
</div>

Myst attempts to assure her friend that Anisha is harmless, hard to say as it’s only been a few days. She mentions the [[Find Familiar\|Find Familiar]] spell, and asks Ruby for input. As she paddles on her bucket, the kobold explains that she can choose the animal form of the fey creature. Myst states Anisha is not fey. 😅 Luk’retia asks if she’s a demon, however that’s really *specific*. It’s fiendish in nature, but whether it’s a devil or demon is up for debate.

Luk’retia asks if she can talk. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Myst talks to her but never gets a verbal response. Anisha flicks her tongue being adorable. The cleric hopes their companions can be friends, but Antari retreats to the back of her head. She inquires if this is her patron. Myst corrects her as they are two separate entities; rather than a snake, Dendar is a god.

“She doesn’t sound very nice,” the cleric adds. It depends. Luk’retia then asks if Anisha came from her — it’s possible due to Myst’s pact, which she is exploring with caution.They converse the differences between a sorcerer, warlock, and wizard. Luk’retia wonders if being a sorcerer means one would need a pact for more magic.

As they discuss, Anisha slithers and coils around Myst’s neck. In her ear she hears, “Shhhhh.” 🤫

Ruby chimes in to clarify. Wizards study to cast magic; sorcerers are born with an innate ability to cast magic, and warlocks gain access to magic through pacts. Myst knows it has nothing to do with her race as she was the only one in her village with the ability to cast. Ruby adds that sorcerers are an anomaly, and we learn Myst knew about her powers very late in life. <span class="spoiler">Considering her age, that means she’s only been dabbling in magic for a handful of years.</span>

Luk’retia then asks if that’s why her magic is wild, but Myst recalls other sorcerers with stable magic. Other types of casters are mentioned — clerics gain magic through their faith, and druids connect with nature. Ruby then mentions that warlocks make a deal with a deity upon an arrangement. Luk’retia asks if Myst made a deal with Wee Jas. She made a deal with something powerful and old, choosing her words carefully. She then clarifies that there are sorcerers who never make a pact and rely solely on their own abilities; she relies on both her abilities and her pact.

>**Luk’retia:** So you get more spells ... and have more fun?
>**Myst:** We’re figuring that out.

Luk’retia ends the conversation by releasing her herbal remedy into the bath. She interacts with Anisha, sticking out her tongue. We clean up afterwards. As the girls leave the bath, they spot Rez sneaking in after them. He acknowledges them briefly at this failed attempt and quickly slips away, rejecting Luk’retia’s herbs. Davena comes up, getting ready to enter, but Myst informs her that Rez is inside. She decides to wait a bit longer.

Luk’retia chides her, but Myst understands wanting privacy, admitting not even Vrok as seen. Though, Luk’retia argues bathing with a male doesn’t have to be sexual — set some boundaries and get in the water. 😅 <span class="spoiler">This explains the conversation from earlier lol.</span>

>Just get your nitty bits clean, because you *stink*.
>
>— the ever subtle, Luk’retia

Vrok walks up to their room and informs them he’s also entering the bath, prompting Davena to want to wait longer. Luk’retia crudely lets her know they won’t gang rape her. Myst, with all seriousness, jokingly says, “Vrok is not the most polite.” Funnily enough, Davena didn’t hear her, and she let’s it slide until Luk’retia interprets her statement as “rough with sex.”

Myst corrects her as she has no experience to go off, nor will she elaborate. However Luk’retia takes that to mean the yuan-ti likes it rough. Both Myst and Davena are dumbfounded, as it’s a lot to unpack. Though the conversation leaves Davena horrified — Ruby giggles. Myst then calls out Luk’retia’s for sexualizing her, referring to a few specific instances. Though Luk’retia argues it was strictly for profit and science, and would never do anything without her consent.

Myst turns to Davena, attempting to lessen her concerns and tells her to go ahead and replace her, flabbergasted by Luk’retia’s reasoning. She mentions other instances where conversations about her body were uncomfortable, though the cleric was only showing support for her friend. Myst expresses she doesn’t need to be so blunt. Luk’retia notes as of late she has been attempting to improve her social skills, and has changed the inflection of her voice to match her intentions. Myst admits she has shown progress, though has grown to like her montone delivery.

Unable to bear her smell, Davena goes to the bath, with encouragement from Myst. She awkwardly enters, chanting, “I’m not here.” At the furtherest corner, she cleans herself away from the guys. Rez ignores her and tells Vrok to do the same at first, but then suggests he go over to make her feel comfortable. She protests. 🤣

>**Rez:** Close proximity, that’s her feel safe.
>**Davena:** Please don’t.
>**DM:** And then you hear a &ast;*proceeds to make water bubble noises*&ast;. She’s like under the water.
>**Rez:** Go save her, she’s drowning. 🤣🤣🤣

While underwater, Davena releases Luk’retia’s herbs which adds a nice aroma. She casts [[Dragon’s Breath\|Dragon’s Breath]] to create more steam, attempting to hide herself whenever she believes they can see her. As the steam rises and dissipates, she jumps out the water, covers herself, and runs out, forgetting to clean up the herbs. She walks back to the room, dresses and curses when Luk’retia reminds her. Myst follows behind to go help her just as the boys exit.

Luk’retia immediately asks Ruby if Myst is okay. The kobold doesn’t know much about her, but has learned a lot in seeing her interactions with the cleric. She instantly knew she was a sorcerer/warlock, but didn’t pry. Luk’retia expresses her concerns as Myst’s friend, confessing she really cares about the yuan-ti. Despite annoying her, she’s working on it. Ruby assures her she’s doing swell.

Luk’reta gives Ruby a look, and asks if she’s a danger to Myst. Ruby points out she removed her curses, but it can also be argued there was an ulterior motive. The kobold exasperates, wanting to go home to Targos. As long as Myst protects her, she protects her back. Satisfied, Luk’retia goes to interact with Anisha, asking about Myst. Ruby polymorphs into a reddish snake in an attempt to talk to the familiar.  It’s a bust, but she got a sense of enjoyment. 😂

Ruby then calls Luk’retia out for hiding information about the necklace she gave Myst. She let’s her know she’s on board if it’s a means of protecting the young yuan-ti. Luk’retia doesn’t want the boys to know, preparing to elaborate. Ruby stares into her soul and gives her a reassuring pat, leaving the cleric confused. She turns her attention back to the snake, just as Myst and Davena return.

The longer she talks, the snake uncoils, and rises to meet her gaze in a curious manner. Luk’retia supposedly makes friends with Anisha, wanting to be friends with Myst’s “friend.” From her peripheral, Myst notes Davena hiding herself, uncomfortable that she’s braless. Myst attempts to encourage her to be confident with her body.

She then goes to retrieve Anisha who slowly coils and wraps around her. Luk’retia points out how cuddly she is, though considering the weather, it’s practically necessary — though she subtly implies Anisha gives off her own heat despite snakes being cold blooded. Luk’retia asks about Myst’s [[Ring of Warmth\|Ring of Warmth]]; though it helps, the yuan-ti would prefer it to be much warmer. Myst expresses her excitement to get a new coat from Ruby once they reach Targos, prompting the kobold to show off her magically altered fur coat. 

Myst remembers she’s in her nightgown, and goes for a blanket, though Ruby wraps the coat around her. It’s the thought that counts. ❤️ Luk’retia offers to cuddle, though Myst needs to talk to Vrok and introduce Anisha to him.

Mysts knocks on the boys door, and Vrok answers, as Rez is out cold, having fallen asleep as soon as he hit the bed. Before getting a look at the bundled form, he pulls her in for a kiss. She excitedly introduces Anisha. The ranger casts [[Speak with Animals\|Speak with Animals]], greeting the familiar. Anisha’s demeanor shifts. She glares intently at Vrok, extends towards him and says “Fool.” 👀👀👀 She coils back.

He attempts to ask why, but she refuses to speak to him after. He studies her for a bit, sensing her condescending him, before turning his attention to Myst, who attempts to justify her behavior. He starts asking about her travels and then remembers the necklace he bought for her. He presents it to her — a silver necklace decorated with diamonds, and little sapphires. He notes she wears a lot of blue, so he hoped it matched.



>**Myst:** (touched) Are you asking me what my favorite color is?
>**Vrok:** Eh ... no, not really, but I am glad you are back to your normal original self.
>**Myst:** (guarded) Oh am too. (bluntly) I was about to kill somebody.

He figures she would have possibly dealt with Luk’retia given her ✨obsession✨ with her blue predicament. Myst admits she would never hurt Luk’retia, and not it’s neither here nor there as she is no longer blue. 🔵👏🏽👏🏽 She hopes it won’t happen again, and conveys the dangers of her magic as no laughing matter. Myst shifts the conversation to answer is initial question, continually singing Ruby’s praises. 

She raises her voice and looks into the room. “Ruby’s amazing Rez.”

He grunts. “‘Kay.”

She briefly describes her travels. She’s glad the group is alive despite their difficulties along the way. Vrok admits it was hard in the beginning until they met Davena. He attempts to be romantic, saying Davena’s magic made it seem like Myst was with them. However she takes it too literally and his advances go over her head. She apologizes. 😂

She describes the intricacies of “romance” on Anguis’Conda. Yuan-ti don’t love — they don’t show emotions — and most marriages were political, if not all. She begins to describe her parents’ relationship — they had several partners at a time, etc. Even when she was around Art, who was with everybody; except her! She’s attempting to learn, though implies it’s a hard concept to grasp.

Vrok acknowledges her growth, and notes he had to grow as well. In the past, he didn’t trust nor get along with anyone. He considered himself to be the silent predator type. He admits the only person he loved before was himself, because that was the only person he could look out for. He grew out of it by trusting our group, and by loving her in away.

Myst argues he has a lot of life experience in comparison to her, especially with most of her development being in seclusion. As they reach the end of their conversation, he expresses they really needed her for the last fight. She humbles herself, concurring she’s not that powerful and that her magic is ✨limiting✨. He disagrees and can’t wait to see what else she can do after she excitedly looks forward to “fucking shit up.”

She warns him not to get in the crosshairs, but he’s always in the back. 🫡

>You’d be surprised. Remember, the wild magic — just because I point straight, doesn’t mean it’s going straight.
>
>— brought to you by Mystsora Tsa’rnn reporting on Wild Magic Shenanigans

He claims he’s tired, especially after a long day, and expresses some remorse in not being able to share a bed with her. She bluntly points out he has a roommate and she has a ✨cuddle date✨ with Luk’retia. <span class="spoiler">Listening from the door, metaphorically Luk’retia pumps her fist in victory. 🤣</span>

He solemnly states he’ll just spoon Rez. This goes over her head, as she notes Rez wouldn’t appreciate it. “I know he’s turning over a new leaf, but he still seems prickly.” 😅 He hugs and kisses her goodnight. As she walks off, Anisha continues to glare at him. He wishes her goodnight as well — if she could flip him off she would.

>I know your intent [...] your aura. Because in a way, I’m that aura too. ... Fuck you.
>
>— Vrok dropping bombs on a mean snake 👀

He gets a demonic chuckle in response. Myst looks to Anisha, and whispers, “I know what you’re doing. Just trust me.” She reenters the girls room. She finds Luk’retia meticulously making the bed in preparation for the cuddle with Anisha in mind having prepared a space for the snake, who willingly accepts. Davena and Ruby are out. Myst asks how they want to do this, to which the cleric replies, “Monkey?” Monkey it is, though it’s warm. 😂 Myst finds comfort in it.

In the morning, the group receives their order from Gresham handed out to them by Ernie. Rez also receives a letter from his guild, congratulating him on defeating the wendigo. He reads a quick report on wolf activity in [[Waterdeep\|Waterdeep]], which mysteriously vanished when pursued. Inside the envelop he finds wolf’s bane. He sends a letter back detailing the false hydra incident.

Few places are open as the town continues to grieve — the bakery, the bookstore, the marketplace, and a clothing store displaying winter items. Davena reminds the group they need to move before Winter’s Crest. Vrok goes off to buy rations. While on the main street, the girls go to the bookstore, the [[Sleepy Cat\|Sleepy Cat]], to which there is a fat cat in the window.

<span class="spoiler">Apparently on the same wavelength, just as Myst looks at the cat predatorily, Luk’retia plots to gift it to either her or Anisha.</span>

A middle age gnome woman, with brown hair in a loose knot, with giant glasses, introduces herself as Banla. She gives them a quick rundown of the shop, and tells us not to mind Pete the cat. Luk’retia asks if he’s for sale, but quickly gets turned down. Apparently a lot of people ask.

Luk’retia asks about unique books, and Banla introduces her to the sequel of *Tusk Love*. 😅
She begins to describe bits and pieces of the themes and plots within the smutty book, prompting Luk’retia to ask about smut. Myst bluntly informs her it has a lot of sex.

Myst asks about books on weird types of magic and spells, with no luck. Banla suggests other topics such as dreams, other worlds (sci-fi), history, etc. Luk’retia asks about healing. Banla calls out to Pete who begins to maneuver through the shelves to retrieve a book for Luk’retia. The girls follow the cat. (Myst stares a bit too intently.)

Luk’retia finds the second volume of the book Whirly retrieve for her on herbalism. Myst follows Pete into the history section, hoping to learn more about Barovia. She notes a few shelves are meant for Pete to climb. He paws at *Myths of Shadows* — thumbing through, it recounts how Barovia vanished off the Material Plane. The theories are skewed to how or why, but a large number of theories point to a punishment or banishment of one darklord, Strahd von Zarovich.

Davena finds *The History of Icewind Dale* — Myst leans over her shoulder in a friendly manner —
a book made around the time the Forstmaiden took over. The page reads, “Cities lost to the frost ...” and continues with a list of the last known locations of each city. Davena points to Ishavel, and adds “That’s the one I’m looking for.”

Myst inquires about the city. Davena describes her quest; she’s here in Faerûn along the Sword Coast to find info on what caused the fall of Ishavel. Something politically happened, and the [[Cobalt Soul\|Cobalt Soul]] charged her to investigate so they can apply it to the empire.  

Myst questions her about the empire, and Davena mentions WIldemount. Skeptical, the yuan-ti gently informs her that [[Wildemount\|Wildemount]] doesn’t exist on [[Toril\|Toril]], recalling her brief studies of geography. Davena is baffled. Luk’retia begins to bring out her maps and Pete even helps.

The girls learn Davena is from a different world — [[Exandria\|Exandria]]. 🤯 She pulls out a book, detailing the history of the war between the empire and [[Xhorhas\|Xhorhas]], specifically the [[Krynn Dynasty\|Krynn Dynasty]]. Luk’retia and Myst ask how she specifically got here. The Cobalt Soul sent her through a massive teleportation circle in Zedash to [[Candlekeep\|Candlekeep]], which is south of Waterdeep. Davena claims she’s not lying, and Myst continually reassures her she believes her. Her scholarly mind awakens and keens at the possibilities. ✨✨✨

Hoping to comfort her after such a bombshell, Myst brings up their awkward interaction, noting she herself lacks social skills. Luk’retia quickly argues she’s learned a lot from Myst, which is concerning. 😅 Davena emphasizes her time with the group is short, and worries that Myst feels that she’s taking her spot. Myst asks why she would worry. 

Davena mentions her interactions with the last group she traveled with, and how her appearance caused issues. Myst boldly states they were insecure, implying she’s not 😏, and apologizes about her experience. She then goes to say she was going to return regardless of whether the Generic Seven needed her nor not.

“We’re friends,” Luk’retia asserts. Myst softly agrees with a warm smile. Luk’retia then asks if Davena has friends, to which she only has Korra and her brother, who she hasn’t spoken to in a while. Myst then asks how long she’s been in Faerûn. Davena arrived a week before the [[Day of Wonders\|Day of Wonders]], and admits to being present during the parade, possibly catching a glimpse of our group. 

Luk’retia speculates she was spying, though Davena assures her that her party knew of her and went out on a mission not to long after. She recounts her steps, starting at Candlekeep, completing a few side quests close to [[Baldur’s Gate\|Baldur’s Gate]], before hearing about the Day of Wonder. They took a day to visit Waterdeep. Myst quickly notes she and Luk’retia need to go to Candlekeep as it is rumored to be an amazing library. Davena confirms.

After, their paladin noted they had a long journey ahead of them, as they were assigned to escort Davena to Ishavel. They traveled northeast, however a few things happened and they separated. She then happened upon the Generic Seven in Heaven’s Breath, and asked nicely if she could join. Luk’retia mentions a frogman — apparently Davena started a rumor started a rumor that Westridge was run by a bullywug. 🐸

Myst shifts to the Cobalt Soul, asking if they told Davena anything before they transported her here. They didn’t teller it was a world join. Luk’retia asks about her sister/friend (Korra), asking if she manipulated Davena, who is not officially part of the Cobalt Soul. Davena doesn’t believe she knew, and adds that her brother would be the one to trick her. Myst continues, wondering why Davena never wondered to look at a map, though the tiefling was led to believe she was in the same world as Faerûn showed many similarities to Exandria.

Attempting to debunk theories, they ask about shared cities and continents. Davena mentions Tal’Dorei, but Myst shoots it down. She apologizes for cursing her with knowledge. The tiefling admits she feels bamboozled. Myst bluntly adds they put her on a mission with little to know information, though Davena tries to justify that it was classified information. 

Luk’retia asks how would she return, and all she has to do is return to Candlekeep via teleportation circle. Myst concludes Candlekeep would be a conduit to jump worlds, lest she end up somewhere random in the cosmos, potentially killing herself.

As the conversation ends, Luk’retia looks up and finds a book on Neverwinter called *Neverember Reign*. It is based on a time, more recent and before the eurption, detailing how Lord Dagult Neverember owned Neverwinter at the same time as Waterdeep. The book glorifies him as a hero who raised up Neverwinter. Myst looks over her shoulder and calls bs. 

“That’s a good book,” Pete the cat interjects from above and then runs off. Myst and Luk’retia send Anisha and Antari after him. Banla screams for us to stop, but he as he’s cornered, he bamfs away via [[plane shift\|plane shift]]. Myst aggressively questions Banla about her cat, who is fey and happened to be on the Material Plane on his own volition. 👀👀👀 He didn’t belong to her.

The girls speculate it may have to do with Neverember, implying the bastard was spying on the group, however fey are tricksy. He could have been anything. Realizing they know little about fey, Myst and Luk’retia asks Banla for related books. The *History of the Feywild* has generic information that most know about the Feywild; a small chapter called “Rifts” details ripples in the planes that allow entry from either plane to either side. Unfortunately, we do not find information about creatures or things manifesting here or there. Myst suggests they ask Vrok.

Luk’retia attempts to look for books on vampires to help Esvele escape her predicament. Myst points out the Myths of Shadows. We quickly brief Davena about the Masquerade, leaving her shook. Luk’retia retreats her into her mind to connect events and other circumstances. She gathers Esvele knew what she was doing, though is not sure if the masquerade was a cover for their arrival. Frustration sets in as she grabs more books to find more information.

Myst expresses her own disappointment and not finding books about Wild Magic. She hopes to visit Candlekeep to search through their shelves, though Ruby warned her there were very little accounts regardless. She also admits to wanting to reverse something, recalling Ruby’s somber tale of her sorcerer friend. They find Davena reading *Tusk Love*, and Myst takes this opportunity to give her *We Were Snakes*. 😂 They buy the books before leaving to reconvene with the rest of their party.

Ruby goes with Rez and Vrok, and retrieves the horses. Luk’retia attempts to find a pet shop or a few stray animals roaming about for Myst, who assures her she’s okay. Ruby chimes in that they share a similar diet and will manage.  Vrok points out he bought plenty of rabbits.

We pack up and begin to head out of town towards [[Port Llast\|Port Llast]] to the north. Ruby is quiet, happy to be riding with Myst, who shares similar sentiments. As we enter the city, Rez looks to the dock, noting a ship is entering though looking for ships that are leaving. We eventually find a small tavern called the [[Lasting Spirits\|Lasting Spirits]]. We‘re greeted by a human female with dark skin and curly hair named [[Zoya\|Zoya]]. Though quiet and small, we enjoy a decent lunch. Zoya offers to prepare rooms for our stay, however, [[Luskan\|Luskan]] is only another hour away.

As we get our horses, we hear a large commotion towards the docks, and being nosy, we make our way over. We find a familiar ship, and a group of pirates fighting with the dockworkers. We then see a familiar tabaxi with leopard spots, [[Whinter\|Whinter]], who kills a dockworker effortlessly. He tips his hat with a smug smile, acknowledging our presence and taunting us. It‘s on sight as we rush into combat, though Myst holds back taking the innocents into account.

We easily overwhelm pirates. Vrok jumps off Rez’s shield to gain height, successfully attacking Whinter and casts [[Hunter’s Mark\|Hunter’s Mark]]. Davena moves up casting [[banishment\|banishment]] on a couple pirates, not questioning our involvement. The dockworkers advance on the other pirates. Rez dashes forward, positioning himself to protect the dockworkers. 

Whinter runs towards the boat, followed by another pirate. As the opportunity presents itself, Myst casts [[fireball\|fireball]] on the hull, effectively hurting the pirate captain and catching the upper deck on fire. She immediately casts [[Firebolt\|Firebolt]] at the other runaway pirate, using her sorcery to manipulate her spells.

The docworkers then surround the remaining pirates and arrest them. As they thank us for our help, we all hear a loud gunshot coming from the boat — [[Whinter\|Whinter]] killed himself, dying on his own terms. 😒😒😒 Vrok and Luk’retia begin to loot, but find that these pirates were running short. It can be assumed they entered the dock to loot until we interfered.

Luk’retia finds a few papers in the captain’s quarters that insinuate that [[Jarlaxle\|Jarlaxle]] hired [[Whinter\|Whinter]] and rendezvoused with him to leave us in [[Anguis’Conda\|Anguis’Conda]]. We argue for a bit about owning a boat — Myst is extremely against the idea. A dockworker comes up and clarifies the boat now belongs to the city of Port Llast. Unsuccessfully, Rez and Luk’retia attempt to make their case, clearly wanting the boat despite the damage. 

At this time, the two banished pirates reappear and are apprehended. Rez asks Davena where she sent them; she assumes the [[Nine Hells\|Nine Hells]], but it could have been anywhere other than space—or rather Wild Space, as it’s not a plane.

The dockworker suggests if they really want the boat, they would need to wait another week or two after the trials, investigations, and other legal matters. Myst continues to argue they don’t need the boat. She turns to Davena and scoffs, “And you were worried about replacing me?” <span class="spoiler">Her intention was to question her joining the group, not provide a snide comment, as she expresses her exasperation with their antics. She meant, “And you <em>want</em> to join this craziness?”</span>

She clarifies. “If you want them ...” Davena isn’t sure they want her, and Myst confirms they do.

Eventually, the “boat lovers” rescind their desire for the boat, though not before grabbing the flag, a few guns, a keg of gunpowder, and a cannonball. We leave towards [[Luskan\|Luskan]], somewhat disheartened until we remember [[Renear\|Renear]] commissioned a sky ship for us. Along the way, Luk’retia prays for Whinter’s soul — whether he made it to Wee Jas or someone else, as long as he serves justice. Within an hour, we enter through the south gate. The town is better lit and more populated than [[Neverwinter\|Neverwinter]].

We see the [[Middle Bird Tavern\|Middle Bird Tavern]] — four birds fly upward, though the third is the longest — and down the street see the [[Macho Glory Inn\|Macho Glory Inn]]. Apparently back in Waterdeep, there is an inn where the staff continuously insult its patrons, which Myst avoided like the plague. Vrok wonders when we’ll return home, though Myst argues they have too much on their plate to even think of home, listing their upcoming endeavors. When she mentions Barovia, Luk’retia inquires, and Rez mentions we need to deal with the vampires who killed innocent souls, attempting to fire her up.

Myst expresses she misses asshole Rez, loves his development, but he doesn’t need to try so hard. 😅

>**Luk’retia:** He’s trying to be sentimental for his [fiancée] ...
>**Rez:** I’m trying to get you fired up and to not be so dead over there!
>**Luk’retia:** That is so disrepectful.
>**Rex:** Very much. ... So?
>**Luk’retia:** Eat shit.

Indecisive of which establishment to enter, we scope them both out. Sailors primarily enter the Middle Bird Tavern, whereas it seems a bit exclusive over at the Macho Glory Inn as no one is walking in — both are lively.  We go to Macho Glory, though we have to pay 10 gp for entry. Luk’retia asks about the establishment, though the male gnome remains cryptic. We hear a loud ruckus happening deep inside.

Rez and Vrok shove past the gnome, irking him. Ruby pushes Myst in while paying for everyone.

A bored barmaid attends the empty bar, looks at us and points us to go to the back. Walking down a set of stairs, we basically find a fight club — there’s a large cage, from floor to ceiling, where an half-orc and a goliath fight ruthlessly. The crowd cheers and jeers, throwing alcohol every which way, as the half-orc claims his victory. 

Luk’retia and Vrok notice an older gentleman stand from his chair. He is then greeted by a gray tabaxi who holds out a heavy large pouch. While the others are in rapture of their surroundings, Myst dissociates, uncomfortable by the display.

The older gentleman speaks out. “Is there no one here who can beat my champion? Anyone?”
