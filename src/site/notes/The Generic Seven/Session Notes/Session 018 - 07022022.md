</div></div>


The Generic Seven wake up in the forest and gather our things. We continue northward. Luk’retia apologizes for attacking us. We then come across a clearing and a sign, “Heaven’s Breath.” It leads to a small village. The other arrow leads to the temple of [[Wee Jas\|Wee Jas]] — Luk’retia immediately goes towards the village which leads to the temple.

Not a lot of people are out in the street, though it’s mundane; typical chores, errands, etc. The population is low and they do not live close to the town. They appear to be farmers. Rez looks around for an inn/tavern, and finds [[the Hare’s Axe\|the Hare’s Axe]]. We reach the edge of town, finding a sign that points to the mountain stating that the temple is about 15–20 miles out.

Luk’retia recalls the surroundings, though not the autumn weather. We continue until Myst complains about sitting too long. They stop for a quick break. Vrok confronts Myst about the other day asking why she initiated, and she’s unsure how to answer him as to why she did what she did. Luk’retia also confronts her, unsure about how that interaction went. Myst attempts to explain that it’s her and not Vrok, revealing she’s unsure how to broach the topic without hurting him due to her emotional immaturity. 

They have a weird conversation leading to Myst bringing up [[remove curse\|remove curse]] and how the succession of events of events have overwhelmed her. Luk’retia tries to explain to Myst that she was probably in love with Art, but Myst immediately shuts her down, denying such claims.

Vrok scouts to see how far we are from the temple — like a day out. We kind of argue about whether to go forward or back to the town, with Luk’retia taking the lead somewhat frustrated. The old inn/tavern she remembers is closed down as the owner moved to Waterdeep for new business opportunities.

[[Alsduke\|Alsduke]], or Alsie, a haregon who is from the Feywild, seems somewhat cautious of us considering we’re curt. Luk’retia attempts to sneak some blueberry ale to him, but out of spite Myst sabotages the deal. Vrok buys a couple rooms — the only rooms Alsie had. He then asks about the temple of Wee Jas. Alsie describes it as a small abandoned cottage with moss, it’s bigger inside. [[Annie\|Annie]], a cleric for Wee Jas, is over at [[Jas Remedies and Brews\|Jas Remedies and Brews]] (teas, flowers, funeral director) says it’s because Wee Jas doesn’t like to call attention to herself. He continues describing the cemetery, and he warns that after dark people go missing along on the short path.

Annie pays her respects to her uncle in the cemetery.

Alsie doesn’t have meat but suggests if we want meat to go to the market. Myst says she’s going to the market and Luk’retia points out that Vrok has been overbearing. Myst reassures him after admitting he as been coddling her and gives him a kiss on the cheek before going. Rez eventually goes to the market once he hears Alise’s menu. Myst is not there, though not that he cares.

Annie is a light-skinned tiefling (Zariel) with antlers, white hair, ornate robes, purple eyes. After dinner, Luk’retia goes out to find Annie finding in the herbal/tea shop. She explains that Wee Jas is exclusive, likes to be in the background, and that she’s not the most popular god in the pantheon. Luk’retia asks about the missing people and the short path. Annie describes it as an urban legend of sorts.

Annie is a cleric, somewhat, but doesn’t fight. She mentions a case where a few children died eating wild berries (nightshade) from the forest river, describing her job with said example.

Luk’retia and Vrok then go to find Myst, not seeing her anywhere and asking around. No one has seen her. They instead find Rez at the stall waiting for his pork chop that is burning as the little old lady is cooking it moving slow as molasses.

Myst went hunting and finds peace in the forest, clearing her head and de-masking. She makes her way back and gets vegetable stew from Alsie, who tells her a little bit about the Feywild when prompted.

Luk’retia prays at the site where the kids found the berries and the blueberries they wanted. Wee Jas asks if she remembers when they first met.

The Generic Seven meet back at The Hare’s Axe and find Myst having a conversation with Alsie. We decide to go to the cemetery where we find the fork in the road, the ceremonial path and the visitor path. Luk’retia notices a dense fog along the path.

Myst notices slash marks and stab wounds — she feels the group is being watched. She points it out, and Luk’retia uses gust to move the fog and notices large foot prints. Luk’retia gets upset, pointing it out and we argue a bit. Suddenly we hear chanting in the trees. Yellow eyes peer as the fog clears and [[Redcap\|redcaps]] descend down on us.

<span class="sticky">With the amount of fey creatures around and considering that people are going missing, there may be rift/portal nearby.</span>

We defeat the red caps and continue down the path. The fog doesn’t lift but the air gets warmer. It’s quiet around the cemetery. There are flowers and greenery, wisteria, weeping willow, cherry blossoms … the air is floral and sweet. Each pot of flowers had bloomed, each grave has a dedicated flower.

Myst loves how peaceful  and quiet it is. Vrok mentions that it’s strange — it is … She asks what he wants after everything … he wants to go back to the Feywild and live a peaceful life mundane life … she admits that’s not exactly what she wants. She’s working toward something …

More weird conversations about anatomy come up before we make our way back to The Hare’s Axe. 🤦🏽‍♀️

Luk’retia has a dream, feeling as though she woke up in the morning. She’s in a different room, and walks out unsteady. She hears woman chanting, her feet are sweating. Blood pools at her feet and she feels  her broken bones/limbs … she walks into an open space seeing the dark sky and snowfall. The chanting gets louder, a skull floats in the back of the room. She looks at Luk’retia warmly … then the dream shifts into a blizzard. She sees a sign pointing to Waterdeep.

Luk’retia asks us to donate to put the eight souls in the dragon’s lair to rest. We’re mostly skeptical but eventually give in with varying amounts.
